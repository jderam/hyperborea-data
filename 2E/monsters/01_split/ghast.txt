A ghast is a rare and potent form of ghoul, an undead
humanoid complexioned pale as a sheet and possessed
of insatiable hunger for human flesh. Although not
immediately distinguishable from ghouls, ghasts oft
are betrayed by the carrion stench they exude, which
can nauseate a man to incapacity. Ghasts are stronger,
faster, and smarter than ghouls, capable of cruel and
calculated schemes.
Special:
¬¬ Immune to poison, paralysis, fear, and cold.
¬¬ Protection from evil holds them at bay.
¬¬ Any living creature within 10 feet must make death
(poison) save or suffer nausea, causing −2 attack
penalty for 1 turn.
¬¬ Silver weapons cause double damage against these
creatures.
¬¬ Hit causes paralysis for 2d6 turns unless death save
is made.
¬¬ Slain victims later become ghouls, though with
2-in-6 chance to become ghasts.
