In deserts and other places of isolation dwell the
lamiæ, mythic witch dæmons that present as beautiful,
curvaceous women with vacuous eyes. They wear
loose-fitting gossamer gowns, through which the
astute might observe their round thighs sheathed in
snakeskin; furthermore, some conceal thin, serpentine
tails that emerge from the bases of their spines.
Lamiæ prefer to prey on men, seducing them and
then drinking their blood for sustenance. Lamiæ arm
themselves with curved daggers of exceptional quality
(forged of diamond-hard glass). They are cruel, sadistic,
Evil creatures who delight in the pain and suffering of
their victims.
Special:
¬¬ 2-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For
every CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty
increases by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p. 261: Saving
Throw, spell resistance).
¬¬ Can cast hallucinatory terrain thrice per day.
¬¬ Voice charms all within 60 feet who hear it, unless
sorcery saves are made. The saves are modified by
willpower adjustment (see Vol. I, p. 9: Attributes,
wisdom), if applicable. Charmed individuals stand
dumbly, allowing the lamiæ to do as they will, even
kill them.
¬¬ Bite victim must make death (poison) save or die
in 1d4 rounds; if save is successful, 3d6 hp damage
sustained (a terrible blood-burning sensation).
