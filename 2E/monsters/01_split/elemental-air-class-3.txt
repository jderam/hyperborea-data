These semi-intelligent whirlwinds present as inverted
cones that shew vaguely humanoid countenances as
they pummel their foes with high-velocity air. Each
type has a truncated bottom diameter of about two feet,
a height in feet equal to its HD, and a top diameter of
approximately half its height; hence an 8-HD specimen
is about eight feet tall with a four-foot-diameter top.
They can move across land or swirl up into the sky.
