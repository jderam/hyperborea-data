The dire wolf is a larger, heavier, more ferocious wolf,
as large as five feet at the shoulder and 500 pounds,
seemingly possessed of semi-intelligence. Typically
dire wolves range across most wilderness environs,
though their lairs usually are located in caves. It is said
that abominable snow-men have devised a means
of training these savage animals to pull their war
sleds. Every pack has an alpha male, which might be a
specimen of maximum hit points.
