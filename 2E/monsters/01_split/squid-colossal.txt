The giant squid is a 60- to 120-foot-long leviathan of
the deep. The largest specimens (colossal squids) are
amongst the most feared beasts of Hyperborea. These
cephalopods are notorious for attacking and sinking
ships. Also they will lurk beneath crafts, anchor two
arms to the hull, and then attack with eight arms,
snatching seamen upon whom to snack. The most
powerful of these beasts are known to have crushed
ships in their arms.
Special:
¬¬ A successful hit is followed by 4d6 hp damage per
round from constriction and toothed suckers. For each
attached arm, the victim suffers a −1 attack penalty.
¬¬ If two or more arms enwrap the same creature,
victim is pulled to the beaked mouth of the beast
for its bite attack, which causes 4d8 hp damage.
¬¬ An arm struck for 16 hp damage is severed or rendered useless (the only
means of breaking free of their grasp). A crippled
arm does not detract from the monster’s overall hit
point total.
¬¬ If a squid loses five or more arms, it jets away at ×3
movement whilst releasing a cloud of ink that fills a
100 × 100 × 100-foot cube of water behind it.
¬¬ If a colossal squid attacks a ship of any size and hits with
six or more arms, it will capsize and sink the vessel
in 2d4 rounds.
