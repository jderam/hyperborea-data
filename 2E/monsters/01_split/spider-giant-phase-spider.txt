The giant phase spider is a huge arachnid that
appears as a seven-foot-long black tarantula, though
it is something more: At will it can shift from one
reality to another, “phasing” to and from worlds such
as Hyperborea to its Æthereal realm of origin. Phase
spiders are web builders, constructing sticky vertical or
horizontal snares. Multiple phase spiders communicate
by means of a haunting whistle, known to raise the
hackles of dogs and to inspire skittishness in horses.
Sages posit that phase spiders might originate from the
same dimension as Kraken, “The Dimensional Dweller”.
N.B.: A variation of this species is said to dwell in the
Plain of Leng and the canyons of the Leng Plateau.
These are known as the purple spiders of Leng, as their
black fur is spotted with purple rings. These creatures
prey upon Esquimaux, men of Leng, and other natives.
