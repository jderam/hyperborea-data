These are massive, seven-foot-tall, flesh-eating gorillas
of brutish, cunning intelligence. They have large fists
with black-taloned fingers. Often carnivorous apes
dwell in hidden places, such as caves, dungeons, or
forests deep. They take great pleasure in eating the
raw flesh of man and are keen to his scent; likewise,
they hate and prey upon other ape species, though
they rightly fear the four-armed albino ape superior.
Carnivorous apes are notorious for their keen eyesight,
hearing, and olfaction; they use these enhanced senses
and their shrewd cunning to stalk enemies.
A rare variation of the carnivorous ape is said to dwell
in the remote peaks of the Spiral Mountain Array.
These simians conform to carnivorous ape appearance,
except they have hollow bones and great, membranous
bat wings. Clever and intelligent, these brutes revel in
cruelty. They are said to capture human females and
convey them to their wicked lairs.
Special:
¬¬ Acute senses; chance to be surprized reduced by
1-in-6.

ape rends its prey for additional 1d8+1 hp damage.
