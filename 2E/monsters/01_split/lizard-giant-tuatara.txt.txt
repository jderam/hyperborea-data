Giant lizard species can be encountered in the more
temperate surface areas of Hyperborea during the
spring and summer years, but by Twilight they will
hibernate. Exceptions include specimens that populate
some of the warmer outer islands, such as New
Amazonia, and those that inhabit warm subterranean
lairs.
A giant tuatara is a carnivorous lizard of eight-foot
length (plus tail), its scales a mottled grey-green. A
nocturnal beast that dwells in its burrow by day, the
giant tuatara rends prey with its claws and powerful
bite, though it oftest feeds on carrion. A subspecies of
skilled swimmers also thrives.
Special:
¬¬ Infrared vision (as the spell) to 120-foot range.
¬¬ Saliva carries deadly bacteria; unless cure disease
cast, bite victims suffer infection, fever, and
weakness. After 2d4+1 days, they must make death
(poison) saves to recover, or die.
