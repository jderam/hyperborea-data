Several snake species inhabit Hyperborea. The asp,
python, rattlesnake, spitting cobra, and viper are
some of the more eminent varieties. They hibernate
during the winter years, except perhaps on the warmer
outer islands, such as New Amazonia.
The asp is a dark, narrow-hooded cobra of from twoto
five-foot length. Its venom is quite deadly, a prized
toxin for the most notorious of assassins.
