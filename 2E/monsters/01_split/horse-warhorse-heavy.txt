These solid-hoofed, herbivorous mammals oft are
domesticated and trained. Typically they have long,
flowing tails and manes and (in Hyperborea) thick,
shaggy coats. Many breeds exist and are classified in
general terms.
A warhorse is bred for strength, power, and the ability
to charge into battle. Non-warhorses must make
morale checks each round they are urged to take part
in combat. If they fail, they will try to flee and possibly
throw their riders.
Special:
¬¬ Horses (but not donkeys, mules, or ponies) can
treble their movement rates in short bursts.
