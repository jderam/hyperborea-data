The least of all dæmonkind, this creature appears as a
pale, mandibulate grub from two to four feet in length,
glistening with reeking slime. It is rather stupid and
tends to attack anything not warded by a protection from
evil spell. It is said that Underborea is honeycombed
with the slimy tunnels excavated by these horrors.
Special:
¬¬ 1-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For
every CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty
increases by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p. 261: Saving
Throw, spell resistance).
¬¬ Cold, electricity, fire, and gas attacks inflict
½ damage, or ¼ damage if save is made.
¬¬ Because of its slippery hide, cannot be grappled,
lassoed, or netted; likewise unaffected by ensnaring
spells such as entangle or web.
