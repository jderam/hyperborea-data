This large, yellow-brown amoeba oozes through caverns
and dungeons seeking flesh and cellulose, which
it devours by way of corrosive enzyme secretions.
Ochre jellies can be as large as 1,000 cubic feet in size,
though gelatinously stretched out over 20 or more feet.
Although they are not believed to possess intelligence,
they exhibit tactical prowess, cornering prey at dead
ends, or surrounding prey by forming a circle or
U-shape. Ochre jellies can squeeze through cracks or
under doors. They can burn through cloth, wood, and
plant material, but do not affect rock or metal.
Special:
¬¬ Harmed only by fire or cold; when ochre jelly is
struck by weapons or lightning, a smaller one is
created (e.g., a 2-HD ochre jelly that causes 1d6 hp
damage), whilst the main body quickly regenerates,
its capacities not reduced.
¬¬ Will opt to attack opponents with the most
exposed flesh first.
¬¬ Corrodes cloth and leather on contact; plant and
wood material is corroded in 1d4 rounds.
