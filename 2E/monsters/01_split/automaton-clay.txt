Automata are humanoid constructs of mad sorcerers
and their ilk, the formulæ for the creation of
which trace back to a bygone age when Atlanteans,
Hyperboreans, and Lemurians commingled sorcery
and science. Strange wires, conduits, batteries, cells,
and circuits are installed in many of these creations,
though no two manuals of automaton creation (see
Vol. V, p. 482: Magical Treasure, miscellaneous
magic items) describe precisely identical processes;
alternative methods of creation were engendered by the
ancients, but this is a lost science in rapidly decaying
Hyperborea.
A clay automaton is a manlike statue eight feet tall.
The clay automaton is under its creator’s command;
typically the creature is appointed a task, such as
guardianship. N.B.: Clay automata are prone to
possession by dæmons.
Special:
¬¬ +1 or better weapon to hit.
¬¬ Immune to sorcery, except for disintegrate and
transmute rock to mud, either of which necessitates a
death save or the creature is destroyed.
¬¬ Unharmed by edged or pointed weapons; only
blunt magical weapons (flail, hammer, mace, etc.)
are effective.
¬¬ Damage from its attacks cannot be healed, save by
the sorcery of a cleric or priest of 9th level or greater;
otherwise, damage inflicted is permanent.
