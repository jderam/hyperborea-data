Not to be confused with the berserker class,
wild berserkers are fighting men who have
succumbed to utter savagery and Chaos, and so
are considered “monsters” by all accounts—and
quite feral, too. They are more beast than
man, and they comprehend little other
than violence and bloodshed; many
even cannibalize their own weak and
infirm. Some sages posit that this
barbarity is due to a species of lotus
they chew. Regardless, most wild
berserkers are a wroth lot, vicious and
cruel, and they respect nothing save power,
intimidation, and domination.
Wild berserkers do not wear armour—their
thick skin provides adequate defence—and they
shun missile weapons (though one might hurl
an axe). They never yield when fighting,
frothing at the mouth and howling
like beasts. For every 25 wild
berserkers there will be
1 sub-chief; for every 50 there
will be 1 chieftain.
