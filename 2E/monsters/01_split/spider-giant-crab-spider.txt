The giant crab spider is a five-foot-long arachnid that
does not use webs to capture prey; rather, it lies in
wait and pounces. Crab spiders’ bodies are somewhat
flat, and (unlike most spiders) their front legs angle
outward, giving them the appearance of crabs; too, they
can move sidewise and backwards as easily as forwards.
Their chameleonic ability allows them to blend with
their environs.
Special:
¬¬ Chameleonic ability increases chance to surprize
by 2-in-6.
¬¬ Can move across walls and ceilings at normal MV.
¬¬ Bite victim must make death (poison) save or suffer
additional 1d8 hp damage.
