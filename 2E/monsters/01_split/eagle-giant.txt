Large, diurnal birds of prey with 25-foot wingspans,
giant eagles are fast, powerful hunters seeking game as
large as a man. Captured prey might be conveyed to a
nest where hatchlings the size of dogs await. The giant
eagle will immobilize its prey whilst the hatchlings
peck flesh. N.B.: In the remote peaks of Hyperborea
dwells an ancient strain of giant eagles possessed of
keen intelligence, aligned with Lawful Good, and of
fearless morale (12).
Special:
¬¬ On a dive attack of at least 60 feet, they make two
claw attacks at a +2 bonus and inflicting double
damage. If the eagle’s intent is to carry prey to its
nest, an avoidance save must be made to escape its
clutches.
¬¬ Captured prey may be borne to the nest and
pinned. Victim must make a test of strength or
dexterity to escape (see Vol. I, p. 7: Attributes,
strength and dexterity); if unable to escape,
hatchlings will commence feeding, pecking the
victim for 1d4 hp damage per round.
