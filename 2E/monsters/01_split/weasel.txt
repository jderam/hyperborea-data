Weasels are fairly common in Hyperborea. During the
winter years, their pelts turn from black or brown to
snow white. When they do, such pelts are said to fetch
as much as 20 gp in certain towns and cities.
Special:
¬¬ Pelt turns white in winter years; camouflage
provides 6-in-12 chance to hide in snow (see Vol. I,
p. 21: Classes, thief).
