This enormous herbivore is about 20 feet long,
weighing as much as 6,000 pounds. The ground sloth
has massive bones, a powerful tail, and coarse, reddishbrown
fur. It stands up to nine feet at the shoulder and
will rear up on its hind legs to browse trees. Ground
sloths walk on the sides of their front feet, owing to
their non-retractable claws of one- to two-foot length.
These creatures are considered docile and slow-witted.
They will defend themselves, but otherwise ignore
potential predators (of which few are known). For
instance, if a pair of desperate sabre-tooths were to
approach a ground sloth, all it would need do is rear up
on its hind legs and display its enormity.
Special:
¬¬ Tail lash lifts and propels smaller prey 1d20+20
feet in the air; additional damage is caused upon
landing (see Vol. III, p. 263: Damage, falling
damage).
