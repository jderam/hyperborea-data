The leaper camel is not a true camel; this kangaroo-like
marsupial has powerful hind legs that it uses to bound.
It has white-and-grey shaggy fur and can endure the
harshest Hyperborean winters. Typically ridden by
abominable snow-men and men of Leng on the
frozen tundra of Hyperborea, these temperamental
beasts can be controlled only by men of 16 or greater
strength. They rarely are available for
purchase and require special saddles
that may cost twice the standard rate.
