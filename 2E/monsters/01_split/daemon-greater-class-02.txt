These abominable dæmons are vaguely humanoid in
shape, though froglike of countenance, with slimy,
warty skin, bulging black eyes, distended bellies, and
batrachian legs upon which they stand upright. Their
webbed fingers are taloned black, and their mouths
are lined with double rows of shark-like triangular
teeth. These dæmons are incredibly violent (including
towards one another), and they relish the taste of
human flesh. They only dwell in the world of men
because someone (or something) has beckoned them
forth.
Special:
¬¬ 8-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For
every CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty
increases by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p 261: Saving
Throw, spell resistance).
¬¬ Cold, electricity, fire, and gas attacks inflict ½
damage, or ¼ damage if save is made.
¬¬ Can cast the following spells at will (though only
one at a time): cause fear (reverse of remove fear),
darkness, detect invisibility, infrared vision, levitate,
telekinesis, teleport (without error).
¬¬ Once per day, can attempt to beckon another
class II greater dæmon to fight alongside it (as
reverse of dismissal), with 2-in-6 chance of success.
Alternatively, it can attempt to summon 1d6 class
ii lesser dæmons or 1d4 class iii lesser dæmons,
with 4-in-6 chance of success.
