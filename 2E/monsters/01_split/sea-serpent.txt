This snakelike leviathan of the sea is up to 100 feet in
length and massive. Sea serpents are of shimmering
blue-green scales, and their bodies project several spiny
fins. They are notorious for taking down small craft,
wrapping their bodies around them and capsizing them
to devour the men overboard. At other times they will
simply lunge and snatch prey from the deck of a
vessel. Sea serpents are held to congregate at the
Rim of the World where the seas spill eternal.
Special:
¬¬ Can wrap around a small ship and
constrict for 3d4 points of hull damage
per round.
¬¬ On a natural 19–20 attack roll, the
monster swallows whole its victim,
inflicting 1d6 hp damage per round
thereafter; after 3 rounds, the victim may
asphyxiate (see Vol. III, p. 263: Special
Damage, asphyxia). Swallowed prey can
cut its way out with a WC 1–3 blade, with an
attack penalty equal to the weapon class. If
18 hp damage is inflicted from within, a large
enough rent is cut for escape.
