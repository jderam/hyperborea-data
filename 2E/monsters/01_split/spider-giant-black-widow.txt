The giant black widow is a six-foot-long arachnid,
black with a red or orange “hourglass” mark on the
abdomen. These spiders weave tangled webs of 100 ×
100 feet or more. A black widow can sense when a living
creature touches its web and at once will move in for
the kill. Encountered black widows are always female;
males are the size of a man’s fist and unaggressive.
Special:
¬¬ If entrapped in a web, a man can break free in
19 rounds − strength score; e.g., 3 rounds with 16 ST.
¬¬ Bite victim must make death (poison) save or
be paralyzed, dying in 1 turn. Wound becomes
necrotic in any event, with 3-in-6 chance of
infection unless cure disease is cast. After 30 days
victim must make another save or die; otherwise,
infection subsides.
