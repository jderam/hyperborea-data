The winter wolf is an Evil, semi-intelligent,
supernatural beast that inhabits the most forbidding
regions. These wolves have pure-white coats, stand
from five to six feet at the shoulder, and weigh as much
as 750 pounds. They can release terrible howls that
discharge blasts of cold, freezing to the bone their prey,
which they then will crush in their horrible jaws. They
are believed to have their own strange language. Winter
wolves fear and loathe the men of Leng, and they leap
in wild, howling fervour when Ythaqqa walks amongst
them or sends his frigid wind.
