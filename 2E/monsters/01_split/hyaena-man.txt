Hyæna-men are seven-foot-tall humanoids of from
low to moderate intelligence. They are covered in thick
brown or white fur (depending on environment) and
have the heads of hyænas. They carry the weapons of
men and gird themselves in armour, though they are
poor manufacturers of such armaments.
Hyæna-men are wild carnivores, sadistic in their
pleasures, excited by fear, and unhesitating cannibals.
When incited, they emit terrifyingly hysterical
laughter. Their language (a combination of barks
and yips) is
unintelligible to
most men.
A hunting
group of 1d6
hyæna-men
might be
encountered,
or a tribe of
6d6. Typically
they venerate
Mordezzan,
though tundradwelling
tribes
will offer sacrifices
to Ythaqqa. For every
20 hyæna-men there
will be a dominant
hyæna-man leader
that stands up to
eight feet in height, a
paragon of ferocity and
madness.
