This is a stone-carven grotesque human, beast, or
devil, typically positioned atop a building or within
a labyrinth, as well as in hills and mountains. Often
they are horned, winged, clawed, and fanged, horrific

sorcery, they can animate to life, fly, and attack, and
they are impervious to mundane weaponry. Possessed
of quasi-intelligence, gargoyles are shrewd and Evil
creatures.
