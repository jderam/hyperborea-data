Snakes of great size inhabit the dark corners of
Hyperborea; whether their prodigious length is a
natural development or the result of sorcery is a matter
of conjecture. Except on some islands at the Rim of the
World, these reptiles are less active during the winter
years.
The giant water snake is a huge black reptile of up to
30-foot length that thrives in fresh water or brackish
marshes. Water snakes emerge to breathe about once
per six hours. Their bite injects slow-acting paralytic
venom. Often a snake will retreat after biting a victim
and lurk nearby, awaiting the poison to take effect so it
then can consume its prey.
Special:
¬¬ Bite injects venom thrice per day. Victim must
make death (poison) save or become numb-skinned
after 1d6 rounds; face muscles also fail to actuate,
and speech is garbled. Paralysis takes effect 1d4
turns later and lasts 1d6+6 turns.
