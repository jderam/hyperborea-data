Giant lizard species can be encountered in the more
temperate surface areas of Hyperborea during the
spring and summer years, but by Twilight they will
hibernate. Exceptions include specimens that populate
some of the warmer outer islands, such as New
Amazonia, and those that inhabit warm subterranean
lairs.
A giant chameleon is a carnivorous lizard of six-foot
length (plus tail), able to blend with its surroundings.
It attacks by striking with its long, sticky tongue and
then biting. It also can use its 10-foot-long tail to batter
targets. The giant chameleon dwells in all environments
save extreme cold.
Special:
¬¬ Blending increases chance to surprize by 2-in-6.
¬¬ If tail sweep hits, target must make avoidance save
or be knocked prone (see Vol. III, p. 242: Combat,
attack modifiers).
