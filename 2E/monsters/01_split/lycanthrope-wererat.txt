Wererats are cunning lycanthropes that lair in
dungeons, abandoned buildings, sewers, and
basements. They can assume three different forms:
that of a human, a rat-man, and a giant rat; however, on
the three nights when Selene is full and the one night
when Phobos is full (see Vol. VI, p. 500: Table 153),
they transform into rat-man form, regardless of their
wishes. Typically they use human form to dupe the
ignorant into entering their lairs. Their rat-man form
is a four- to five-foot humanoid with a rat’s head, a
human body (albeit coated in rat fur), and a rat’s long
tail; the above statistics reflect this form. In their giant
rat form they have the statistics of a giant rat, but
retain their current hit points and the Special abilities
noted hereafter.
Special:
¬¬ Horses are keen to the presence of lycanthropes
and will snort with fear when they approach.
¬¬ Harmed only by silver or magical weapons.
¬¬ If wolfsbane is wrapped about the point of a spear
or like weapon, and a lycanthrope is struck, it
must make a death (poison) save or flee in panic (or
possibly cower and surrender).
¬¬ Bite confers lycanthropy unless a death (poison)
save is made.
¬¬ If killed, lycanthrope
reverts to human form.
¬¬ Every 91 days, when
both moons are full,
all lycanthropes are
especially ferocious,
gaining +2 damage
bonuses to every
successful attack. During
this period they also are
enhanced temporarily
by +2 hp per HD; these
bonus hit points are
deducted first when the
lycanthrope is damaged,
and they dissipate as the
moons wane.
¬¬ Can summon 3d4 giant rats once per day, which
arrive 1d4 rounds later.
