Automata are humanoid constructs of mad sorcerers
and their ilk, the formulæ for the creation of
which trace back to a bygone age when Atlanteans,
Hyperboreans, and Lemurians commingled sorcery
and science. Strange wires, conduits, batteries, cells,
and circuits are installed in many of these creations,
though no two manuals of automaton creation (see
Vol. V, p. 482: Magical Treasure, miscellaneous
magic items) describe precisely identical processes;
alternative methods of creation were engendered by the
ancients, but this is a lost science in rapidly decaying
Hyperborea.
A flesh automaton is built from the corpses of at least
five men. Though the creature is impervious to most
harm (unless magical), the creator might yet gird his
golem in armour. The flesh automaton obeys the will
of its creator; commands must be simple, for the brute
retains limited intelligence.
Special:
¬¬ +1 or better weapon to hit.
¬¬ Immune to charm, hold, sleep, and other mindaffecting
sorcery.
¬¬ Electrical attacks heal the monster instead of
damaging it.
¬¬ 1-in-10 chance per round of combat that creature
loses control, attempting to kill all in sight. It
attacks berserkly at +2 to attack and damage
rolls and then flees after 2d6 rounds. It thereafter
will wander aimlessly, avoiding civilization;
rehabilitation is no simple matter. Some flesh
automata are said to manifest rudimentary
intelligence and emotion after such episodes.
