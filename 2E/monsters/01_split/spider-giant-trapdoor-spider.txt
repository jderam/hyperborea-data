The giant trapdoor spider is a seven-foot-long
arachnid that digs a burrow in the ground, which it
covers with a lid or trapdoor built of mud and silk,
some folding open from the middle. When prey passes,
the spider springs out to attack. Its bite delivers venom
that may be deadly. Giant trapdoor spiders’ burrows are
tubular and can be as long as 75 feet. They are lined with
silk webs and may have branches that serve as extra
hiding places; inside the burrows are also their nests.
Special:
¬¬ If entrapped in a web, a man can break free in
19 rounds − strength score; e.g., 3 rounds with 16 ST.
¬¬ Chance to surprize increased by 2-in-6 when
pouncing from trapdoor nest.
¬¬ Bite victim must make death (poison) save or suffer
1 hp damage per round for 2d6 rounds.
