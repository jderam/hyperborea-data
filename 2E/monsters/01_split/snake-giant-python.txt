Snakes of great size inhabit the dark corners of
Hyperborea; whether their prodigious length is a
natural development or the result of sorcery is a matter
of conjecture. Except on some islands at the Rim of the
World, these reptiles are less active during the winter
years.
The giant python is an enormous snake of from 20-
to 40-foot length, with scales of alternating colours
and patterns (oft spiroid), depending on its native
environment. They will bite and latch on to their
prey and then constrict the victim until he ceases to
struggle. Many have a taste for man. A pale grey-white
species with blue and yellow markings is said to thrive
in wintery conditions.
Special:
¬¬ Infrared vision (as the spell) to 60-foot range.
¬¬ Upon successful bite, giant python constricts
prey for 2d6 hp damage per round. Victim
can attempt to escape via extraordinary feat
of strength or dexterity (see Vol. I,
p. 7: Attributes, strength and dexterity).
Otherwise, allies whose strength totals at
least 75 can remove snake in 1d4 rounds.
¬¬ Whilst constricting prey, giant python suffers
a −2 AC penalty (AC 8).
