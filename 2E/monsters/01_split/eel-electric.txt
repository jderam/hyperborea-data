This is a giant, serpentine fish of from 30- to 60-foot
length, with poorly developed fins and slimy skin of
brown colour. Electric eels inhabit freshwater lakes,
ponds, rivers, streams, and wetlands. They use their
ability to generate electricity to shock their prey and
then devour it; in Hyperborea, such prey includes men.
Special:

affecting all within a 15-foot radius for 3d8 hp
damage (sorcery save for ½ damage, modified by
defence adjustment, if applicable; see Vol. I, p. 7:

water of at least ankle depth.
