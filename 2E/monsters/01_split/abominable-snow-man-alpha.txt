These despicable, flesh-eating humanoids inhabit the
coldest, least hospitable regions. They stand eight feet
tall, weigh 350–400 pounds, and are covered in shaggy,
grey-white fur. From the centre of this humanoid’s
head protrudes a single horn. Its hands are enormous
taloned paws suitable for rending flesh and bone.
The pelt of an abominable snow-man is considered a
hunter’s prize.
Abominable snow-men speak their own primitive
tongue, can craft simple stone tools, and are known to
tame leaper camels, much like their feared nemeses,
the men of Leng. As no females of the species exist,
abominable snow-men must take human women as
their mates. This tragic, unspeakable union always
results in the birth of an abominable snow-man infant
and the death of the mother.
In the wild, small groups of abominable snow-men are
encountered. In their mountain cave lairs, larger tribes
abide together, finding strength in unity and raiding
human settlements for mates. For every 8 abominable
snow-men there is 1 abominable snow-man alpha, a
500-pound brute.

victim in a bear hug for 2d6 hp damage.
