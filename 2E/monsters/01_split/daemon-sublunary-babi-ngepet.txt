From some frightful netherworld hail these shapeshifting
dæmons that prey on man wherever he is most
vulnerable. Babi-ngepet are devourers of human flesh,
able to assume the forms of giant hogs five feet long,
three feet at the shoulder, and weighing as much as 650
pounds; or they may take the shape of enormously fat
men of ruddy porcine countenances. Their dæmonic
powers allow them to shape-shift freely at night, but
once dawn breaks they are cursed to maintain until
dusk whichever form they last selected. In Hyperborea
(and perhaps elsewhere), babi-ngepet have engaged in
unspeakable relations with dæmon-worshipping Picts,
and so was born the orc race.
Special:
¬¬ 7-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For
every CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty
increases by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p. 261: Saving
Throw, spell resistance).
¬¬ Harmed only by silver or magical weapons.
¬¬ Can cast charm person thrice per day; sorcery save at
−2 penalty.
