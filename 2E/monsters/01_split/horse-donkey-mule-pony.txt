These solid-hoofed, herbivorous mammals oft are
domesticated and trained. Typically they have long,
flowing tails and manes and (in Hyperborea) thick,
shaggy coats. Many breeds exist and are classified in
general terms.
A donkey is a domesticated ass that stands about
four feet at the shoulder and has thick, shaggy fur.
Donkeys are renowned for their loud braying. A mule
is a cross betwixt a male donkey and a mare (female
horse); these creatures are similar to donkeys, though
generally hardier. A pony is a diminutive horse of
approximately 12 hands height (about four feet at the
shoulder), covered with shaggy fur. Ponies are of even
temperament and can be led through cramped tunnels.
