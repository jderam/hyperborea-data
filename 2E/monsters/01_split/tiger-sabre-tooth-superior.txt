The sabre-tooth superior is
the largest of the great cats.
This six-legged beast has stout
limbs and a thick, heavily
muscled back. Adults measure
up to 12 feet long (plus tail)
and 5 feet at the shoulder,
weighing 1,200 pounds. Their
coats are tan and spotted,
and their canine teeth are 12 inches long. These are the
most feared predators of the Hyperborean steppes,
taking down the largest herbivores—as well as other
carnivores. Usually they ignore men, unless desperate
or threatened. They typically rear up on their hind legs
when fighting, rending with their front four claws.
Special:
¬¬ All tigers are superior stalkers; chance to surprize
increased by 2-in-6.
