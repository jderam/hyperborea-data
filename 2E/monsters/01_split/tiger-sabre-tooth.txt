A sabre-tooth is an enormous and powerful cat built
for strength; it has short limbs, a thick, powerful
body, and curved canine teeth of 10-inch length. The
hindquarters are striped, the front thickly furred with
spots. Adults measure up to 10 feet long (plus tail)
and 4 feet at the shoulder,
weighing 800 pounds.
Hunters of giant elk, woolly
mammoths, and musk oxen,
these great cats range over
plains and tundra, scarcely
finding men worth their
efforts, but they will attack if
desperate or incited.
Special:
¬¬ All tigers are superior stalkers; chance to surprize
increased by 2-in-6.
¬¬ If both claw attacks hit, the cat automatically rakes
with its two rear claws for 2d4 hp damage each.
