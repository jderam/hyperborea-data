The stag beetle is the most enormous of giant beetles,
with a body of 12-foot length and horns that project
another 8–10 feet. Heavily armoured and given little
cause to fear most predators, these enormous insects
are the bane of crop farmers, oft consuming an entire
harvest in the course of one night (though they attack
men only if incited). They typically travel alone or in
pairs.
