The fire salamander is a terrestrial species of fire
elemental, serpentine in form (though four-legged),
with the head and limbs of a lizard. The beast is as long
as 15 feet and has bright red scales banded orange,
black, and yellow. Fire salamanders typically dwell near
volcanoes, though sometimes too in deserts. They are
semi-intelligent, malicious creatures, capable of great
cruelty, and they attack ice salamanders on sight.
Special:
¬¬ Immune to fire.
¬¬ Emits intense heat; any creature within 20 feet
suffers 1d8 hp damage per round.
