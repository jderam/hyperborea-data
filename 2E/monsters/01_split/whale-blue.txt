The blue whale is the largest marine mammal of
Hyperborea. It reaches lengths of 100 or more feet
and has speckled blue-grey or white skin. It feeds on
krill and will not seek human prey, but might swallow
a lone swimmer if hungry enough. If harpooned the
blue whale can be quite deadly, overturning the largest
vessels. Typically they feed in the shallow waters of
coastal Hyperborea and breed near the Rim of the
World.
Special:
¬¬ If bite attack hits by a margin of 4 or more (or on a
natural 20 in any case), victim is swallowed whole,
inflicting 1d6 hp damage per round thereafter; after
3 rounds, the victim may asphyxiate (see Vol. III,
p. 263: Special Damage, asphyxia). Swallowed
prey can cut its way out with a WC 1–3 blade, with
an attack penalty equal to the weapon class. If 20
hp damage is inflicted from within, a large enough
rent is cut for escape.
