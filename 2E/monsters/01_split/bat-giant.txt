A giant bat is a bloodthirsty bat of four-foot wingspan.
Continental species present copper-brown fur during
high summer and white fur for the remaining calendar
years; island species usually remain copper perennially.
In Hyperborea, Xathoqquans hold this creature in high
esteem, perhaps of spiritual import.
Special:
¬¬ 1-in-4 bats will carry a disease. A bite victim
must make a death (poison) save or suffer pain
and burning at the site of the infection, followed
by headaches, muscle spasms, and difficulty
swallowing. Death ensues in 2d6 days unless cure
disease is cast.
¬¬ Bite causes paralysis for 1d10 rounds unless death
save is made; bat will then drain victim of blood,
causing 1d4 hp damage per round for 2d4 rounds,
before flying away. If victim survives, disease also
must be checked, as above.
