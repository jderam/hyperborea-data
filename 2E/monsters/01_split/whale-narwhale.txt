The narwhale is a grey, spotted, 20-foot-long mammal
prized for its great spiral horn of from 8- to 10-foot
length (valued at 2,000 gp), found only on the males of
the species. Peaceful and intelligent, these “unicorns
of the sea” scour glacial waters for prey and will
molest a man only if threatened—except in the case of
fish-men, which they attack on sight. Narwhales are
believed to communicate via telepathy.
Special:
¬¬ If incited (e.g., pups threatened), can deliver
a charge attack (see Vol. III, p. 249: Combat
Actions, melee) for treble damage dice (6d6).
