Shrieker fungi are unintelligent, ambulatory plants
from three to five feet in height. The fungus’ shape
corresponds to a mushroom, though with a stem of
one-foot diameter and an umbrella-like cap of from
three- to five-foot diameter. Exclusively they thrive in
cool, lightless, subterranean environments.
Shrieker fungi are nontoxic and edible. The
distinguishing feature of this species (besides its
ambulation) is its ability to release an ear-piercing
shriek in reaction to the proximity of light (e.g., torch,
lantern, sorcery) within 30 feet. The shriek lasts for
about three minutes and will begin anew if light still
remains in its presence.
Special:
¬¬ The shriek of this plant trebles the probability of
attracting wandering monsters.
