The killer whale is a black and white hunter of the
sea, up to 30 feet long and weighing as much as 30,000
pounds. Killer whales (orcas) prey on fish, mammals,
and other whales. Of course, they will devour men, too.
Special:
¬¬ On a natural 20 attack roll, a Small or Medium
victim is swallowed whole, inflicting 1d6 hp
damage per round thereafter; after 3 rounds,
the victim may asphyxiate (see Vol. III, p. 263:
Special Damage, asphyxia). Swallowed prey can
cut its way out with a WC 1–3 blade, with an attack
penalty equal to the weapon class. If 20 hp damage
is inflicted from within, a large enough rent is cut
for escape.
