These are the risen skeletons of animal carrion, raised
to serve the vile purposes of some wicked necromancer.
They are fearless in their guardianship, but their
comprehension of directives is dubious at best. They
will attack using a means standard to their type, though
limited to one such attack per round; too, undead
animals no longer retain special abilities such as flight,
musk, venom, and so forth. For more information,
refer to the spells animate carrion, animate carrion II, and
animate carrion III.
Special:
¬¬ Immune to poison, paralysis, fear, and cold.
¬¬ Edged and piercing weapons cause ½ damage
against them (damage dice halved, with bonuses
added afterwards), but blunt weapons inflict
normal damage.
