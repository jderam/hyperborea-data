These horrific, treble-headed magical beasts are
four feet at the shoulder and weigh as much as 700
pounds. A chimæra has the forequarters of a lion, the
hindquarters of a goat, the membranous wings (25-foot
span) of a giant bat, and the reticulated tail of a serpent.
The central head of the beast is that of a black-maned
lion, with eyes reflecting wicked intelligence. The lion
head is flanked by a goat’s head and the serpentine
head of a hydra. Chimæras are magical creatures
that lair alone in cliff-side caves, woodland hills, and
even dungeons. They speak an ancient tongue of the
underworld, but also they can converse in the Common
tongue of men.
Special:
¬¬ Thrice per day, in lieu of its other attacks, a
chimæra can breathe from its lion head a cone of
fire 50 feet long and 20 feet wide at the terminus,
for 4d6 hp damage (avoidance save for ½ damage).
