Reindeer are larger, standing four or more feet at the
shoulder and weighing as much as 400 pounds. Too,
the spread of their antlers is much larger, and they are
generally furrier, thriving in tundra regions. Reindeer are
herded by Esquimaux, utilized for their meat, milk, and
hides. They can be domesticated and trained in teams to
pull sleds. Some nomadic Esquimaux, particularly those
with strains of Lapp in their blood, are known also to
saddle and ride reindeer.
Special:
¬¬ Charging gore attack results in double damage dice.
