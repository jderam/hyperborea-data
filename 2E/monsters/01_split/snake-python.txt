Several snake species inhabit Hyperborea. The asp,
python, rattlesnake, spitting cobra, and viper are
some of the more eminent varieties. They hibernate
during the winter years, except perhaps on the warmer
outer islands, such as New Amazonia.
The python ranges 11–20 feet in length, with scales of
alternating colours and patterns (oft spiroid) depending
on its native environment (e.g., forests, grasslands,
swamps). The python bites, constricts, and then
swallows whole its prey.
Special:
¬¬ Infrared vision (as the spell) to 30-foot range.
¬¬ Upon successful bite, python constricts prey for
2d4 hp damage per round. Victim can attempt to
escape via extraordinary feat of strength or dexterity
(see Vol. I, p. 7: Attributes, strength and
dexterity). Otherwise, allies whose strength totals at
least 60 can remove snake in 1d4 rounds.
¬¬ Whilst constricting prey, python suffers a −2 AC
penalty (AC 9).
