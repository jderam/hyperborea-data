Snakes of great size inhabit the dark corners of
Hyperborea; whether their prodigious length is a
natural development or the result of sorcery is a matter
of conjecture. Except on some islands at the Rim of the
World, these reptiles are less active during the winter
years.
The giant asp is a dark, narrow-hooded cobra of about
12-foot length. These dungeon-dwelling reptiles are
notorious for their deadly venom. In the darkest pits
they congregate up to a score, writhing together.
Special:
¬¬ Bite injects venom thrice per day. Victim must
make death (poison) save or die at once; even if save
is successful, 6d6 hp damage is sustained (a terrible
blood-burning sensation). Site of wound is
purple and swollen; may become septic if
victim survives (cure disease heals).
