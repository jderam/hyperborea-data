This hated magical beast is the result of sorcery: a
small, feathered, volucrine monster up to 12 inches in
length, with a long, bloodsucking proboscis (not unlike
that of a massive mosquito) and pteropine wings. They
are egg-bearing creatures, feeding on the blood of their
victims (typically mammals) and regurgitating it onto
their eggs. They are attracted to blood and sweat, the
scent of which they can detect half a mile away. When
they strike, they plunge their proboscises into their
prey and proceed to drain blood until sated. Stirges oft
are found in forests and swamps, particularly where
ground sloths and thew waggons dwell, but they also
are encountered in cavernous dungeon depths.
Special:
¬¬ +2 bonus on initial attack roll.
¬¬ Drains victim for 1d4 hp damage per round; after
about 12 hp, the sated stirge flies away.
