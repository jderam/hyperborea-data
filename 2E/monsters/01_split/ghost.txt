Many forms of ghost exist, from benevolent to malign,
with several degrees of nuisance and inconvenience
betwixt and between. Harmful, malicious ghosts
manifest as apparitions of dead men, haunting and
nebulous images. Cursed with undeath, these hateful,
restless beings despise living men and find perverse
pleasure in draining their life essences to derive
sustenance.
Special:
¬¬ Sight inspires intense fear that causes victims to
flee by most expeditious means possible for 2d6
rounds, unless sorcery saves are made. The saves are
modified by willpower adjustment (see Vol. I, p. 9:
Attributes, wisdom), if applicable.
¬¬ Immune to poison, paralysis, fear, and cold.
¬¬ Harmed only by silver or magical weapons.
¬¬ Touch attack causes victim to age 13 years
(1 Hyperborean cycle) unless death save is made.
Only the spell restoration can reverse this terrible
effect. N.B.: This ageing is purely physical; if using
the optional ageing rules, strength, dexterity, and
constitution are affected, but intelligence and
wisdom are not (see Vol. I, p. 104: Table 39).
