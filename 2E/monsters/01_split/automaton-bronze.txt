Automata are humanoid constructs of mad sorcerers
and their ilk, the formulæ for the creation of
which trace back to a bygone age when Atlanteans,
Hyperboreans, and Lemurians commingled sorcery
and science. Strange wires, conduits, batteries, cells,
and circuits are installed in many of these creations,
though no two manuals of automaton creation (see
Vol. V, p. 482: Magical Treasure, miscellaneous
magic items) describe precisely identical processes;
alternative methods of creation were engendered by the
ancients, but this is a lost science in rapidly decaying
Hyperborea.
A bronze automaton is a massive 10-foot construct
built to resemble a minotaur. A typical bronze
automaton is fashioned to wield a great spear, halberd,
or trident, composed entirely of bronze. The bronze
automaton is ever obedient and under the command of
its creator, though it only responds to clear and loudly
vocalized commands. N.B.: The golden heart of a felled
bronze automaton, if extracted, has a 12,000-gp value.
A clay automaton is a manlike statue eight feet tall.
The clay automaton is under its creator’s command;
typically the creature is appointed a task, such as
guardianship. N.B.: Clay automata are prone to
possession by dæmons.
