The bombardier beetle is a five-foot-long insect that
inhabits swamps and woodlands, feeding on carrion
and dung. It uses the latter to build its nest: a dung
tower of 30-foot height with a 30-foot-diameter base. It
does not attack unless surprized or threatened; if so, it
will turn to release its terrible vapour bomb (see Special).
Special:
¬¬ Once per day, can release from its posterior a
noxious vapour bomb 10 cubic feet in volume. The
cloud is acidic and inflicts 2d6 hp damage to any
creature in the area of effect. Furthermore, the
release is coupled with a sonic boom that will
stun any creature within 20 feet unless it makes
a transformation save. If the saving throw
fails, the victim is stunned for 1d6 rounds
(see Vol. III, p. 242: Combat, attack
modifiers) and deafened for an additional
1d6 turns. A deaf creature is surprized
on a base 4-in-6 chance and suffers an
individual initiative penalty of −2
(i.e., the deaf creature may lose initiative,
despite its allies winning; see Vol. III,
p. 244: Combat, surprize and initiative).
Other penalties may apply, at the referee’s
discretion.
