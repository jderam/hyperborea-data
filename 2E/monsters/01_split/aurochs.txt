This massive species of ox stands six feet at the
shoulder, weighs as much as 2,000 pounds, and is
renowned for its wide spread of forwards-turning
horns. Most aurochs have black fur, which is shaggier
during cold periods. Temperamental and aggressive,
these bovines will charge down men, including those
who attempt to avoid them. Some castrated bulls,
if taken as calves, may be used as draught animals.
Solitary bulls might be encountered, or small herds.
Special:
¬¬ Initial gore as charge attack at +2 bonus and
double damage dice (see Vol. III, p. 249: Combat
Actions, melee).
¬¬ Can gore two adjacent foes on a single attack roll.
