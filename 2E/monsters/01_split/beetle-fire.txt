The fire beetle is a giant insect of from 3- to 3½-foot
length, with large, serrated pincers. Fire beetles are
found in two distinct types: one, subterranean; the
other, aboveground, nocturnal bog dwellers.
(The latter oft are referred to as “jigs” because of the
male’s strange mating rituals: It will stand erect on
its hind legs and perform a dance to attract females.)
Two brightly glowing glands are located above the
fire beetle’s eyes, with a third by the abdomen. For the
subterranean type, these glands radiate red light in a
10-foot radius; surface-dwellers present a more fulvous
phosphorescence. If a fire beetle’s glands are extracted
carefully, they will continue to glow for 1d6 days.
