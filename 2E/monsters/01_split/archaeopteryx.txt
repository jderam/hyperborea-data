This crow-sized, antediluvian bird is of rare and
colourful plumage. It has a lengthy reptilian tail with
long feathers of blue, green, black, and pink. The
archæopteryx’s beak is lined with small, sharp teeth;
also, three finger-like claws extend from the wing
joints, used to climb trees and rocks.
Archæopteryges dwell in regions of high elevation that
are volcanically active; also they have been observed
on remote islands and in ancient forests. Typically
they feed on carrion and small animals (amphibians,
birds, mammals, and reptiles). Rare archæopteryges
are attracted to sorcerers; the creatures can be trained
as familiars, these examples demonstrating empathic
understanding of their masters’ wishes. Some have
suggested that these rare specimens are dæmonically
possessed.
Special:
¬¬ If both claw attacks hit one opponent, it uses wing
claws to rend, each causing an additional 1d2 hp
damage.
