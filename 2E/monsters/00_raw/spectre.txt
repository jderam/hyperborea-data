These malevolent, incorporeal undead beings are
empowered by the negative energy of the Black
Gulf. Appearing as ghostly manifestations, spectres
haunt unhallowed crypts and tombs and like places
of desolation. They despise life almost as much as
sunlight, and with their chilling touch they are
notorious for sating themselves on the life energies of
men.
Special:
¬¬ Spectres are helpless in daylight, unable to attack
or defend.
¬¬ Immune to poison, paralysis, fear, and cold.
¬¬ A raise dead spell automatically kills a spectre.
¬¬ +1 or better weapon to hit.
¬¬ Touch drains 1d2 levels of experience unless a
death save is made (see Vol. III, p. 263: Special
Damage, energy drain). If a man is drained to 0th
level, one day later he will become a spectre serving
the one who drained him.
