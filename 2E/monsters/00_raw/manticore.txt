This horrific beast of legendry has the goat-horned head
of a man whose face betrays madness; the body of a
robust lion; great pteropine wings; and the tail stinger
of a giant scorpion. Manticores are sadistic creatures
with tastes for human flesh. Typically they dwell in
mountains, deserts, or abandoned places, such as castle
ruins. Manticores are known to follow the scent of
travelling men, seeking ambush.
Special:
¬¬ If stinger hits, victim must make death (poison)
save or suffer paralysis in 1d4 rounds, frothing
terribly and gagging; death follows in 1d3 turns.
