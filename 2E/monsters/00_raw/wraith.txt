This incorporeal, extra-dimensional undead entity
presents as the pale apparition of a man, translucent
and misty of form. Wraiths are composed of negative
energy of sepulchral stench. They hunger to take their
provender of positive energy—sentient life such as
Hyperborea supports—and from the Black Gulf they
arrive. They dwell in shadows, nocturnal hunters of
life. Often wraiths are servants to a higher power or
otherworldly master.
Special:
¬¬ Powerless in direct sunlight.
¬¬ Immune to poison, paralysis, fear, and cold.
¬¬ Hit only by silver or magical weapons.
¬¬ Touch drains 1 level of experience unless a
death save is made (see Vol. III, p. 263:
Special Damage, energy drain).
¬¬ A man slain by a wraith will
become a wraith in 24 hours,
serving the monster that
slew him.
