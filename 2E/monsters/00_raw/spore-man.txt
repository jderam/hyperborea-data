Spore-men present as men, cave-men, ape-men, orcs,
or other mammalian humanoids. However, they have
been infected by the spores of the russet mould, a
highly intelligent fungus of otherworldly origin able
to endure the cold vacuum of the Black Gulf, traversing
the cosmos on comets and meteors. When a mammal
steps within five feet of the russet mould, it releases
rust-coloured spores. The target must make a death
(poison) save or suffer infection; cure disease is effective
if cast within 48 hours.
Aggressively the spores multiply and release an
enzyme that breaks down flesh, muscles, and organs,
all quite painful and debilitating. This necrosis kills
most mammals after 48 hours, but with men and other
mammalian humanoids, the spores form a symbiotic
relationship, controlling the host like a puppet. The
spores cover the victim in lumpy russet mould, joining
with the skin and hair and leaving two dead white eyes.
Notwithstanding, the victim still can be saved and
revived via a cure disease spell from a CA 6 or greater
sorcerer; survival also requires a trauma survival check
(see Vol. I, p. 8: Attributes, constitution).
Spore-men reserve the highest esteem for Yug and
Azathoth. Often they assume positions of leadership in
the societies of cave-men (their primary host species),
selectively infecting their leaders. Spore-men are
strong, intelligent, cruel, and manipulative. From their
hands they can form sickle claws of three-foot length,
composed entirely of spores as hard and sharp as steel.
Special:
¬¬ Can exhale spores once per day in a cone 20 feet
long and 10 feet wide at the terminus. Target must
make death (poison) save or suffer russet mould
infection, as above.
