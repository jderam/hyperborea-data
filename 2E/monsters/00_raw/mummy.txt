A mummy is an undead monster born of maleficent
necromancy using the prepared corpse of a man. In
general the corpse is dehydrated and wrapped in resincoated
linen strips that prevent the introduction of
moisture. The rites and incantations then performed by
the sorcerer are forbidden and rightly damning to one’s
soul, oft requiring the use of sacred mystery tomes.
Some mummies are born of pacts agreed upon by the
imminent dead (whilst still mortal) and dæmons or
other netherworldly agents. Rarest is the mummy able
to retain its former will and intelligence; termed the
sons of Nyarlathothep, these mummies crave power and
domination.
Regardless their origin, once animated, mummies
are renowned for haunting ancient tombs and crypts,
serving as death guardians of incredible power. Even
the most noble of Lawful Good men raised to mummies
become beasts of Chaotic Evil, hell-bent on the
destruction of the living when their crypts are violated.
The mere sight of a mummy can immobilize a man in
terror, and its touch serves death.
Special:
¬¬ Sight of a mummy within 60 feet paralyzes men
with fear for 2d4 rounds unless sorcery saves are
made, modified by willpower adjustment (see Vol. I,
p. 9: Attributes, wisdom), if applicable.
¬¬ Immune to poison, paralysis, fear, and cold.
¬¬ Vulnerable to fire: +2 hp per die of damage.
¬¬ Unharmed by non-magical weapons; magical
weapons inflict ½ damage.
¬¬ Touch infects victim with horrible rotting disease,
unless death (poison) save is made. This bane
prevents the function of sorcerous healing (spells,
scrolls, and potions); furthermore any wounds
suffered require 10 times as long to heal naturally.
The disease is deadly within 2d6 weeks; only cure
disease can end the affliction.
