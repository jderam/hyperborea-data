A centaur has the head, arms, and torso of a man, and
the body of a thick-boned mountain horse. The equine
portion is covered in shaggy grey fur, matched by a
massive shock of hair that forms a dense and tangled
protective mane. Protruding from the head of a male
centaur is a pair of stout, yellow horns, which he will
use for sparring (possibly to establish mating rights).
Centaurs of Hyperborea typically dwell in the coldest
and harshest environments, in the heart of the Spiral
Mountain Array; scarcely do they reside elsewhere. They
oft venerate Aurorus and Ythaqqa and make clandestine
pilgrimages to Mount Vhuurmithadon. By and large,
centaurs are wary of men and typically seek to avoid
them. If encountered, however, they speak a dialect
of proto-Hellenic that is about 65% compatible with
Kimmerian. They are not immediately hostile unless
threatened; however, they take a resentful viewpoint of
Apollo and Artemis.
Special:
¬¬ Some will carry large shields; such centaurs have
AC 4 vs. melee attacks and AC 3 vs. missiles.
¬¬ Mastery of two weapons (+1 to attack and damage
rolls, increased attack rate, etc.; see Vol. I, p. 112:
Weapon Skill, weapon mastery); most centaurs
favour the longbow and long spear, though
exceptions are possible.
¬¬ Can cast the following spells at will (though only
one at a time): charm person or beast, færie fire, find
plants, goodberry, pass without trace, sanctuary from
animals, starlight.
