A hill giant is a massive humanoid 12 feet in height
and weighing as much as 1,500 pounds. These brutes
are misshapen and warty, with thick, hairy hides.
They oft will wear thick pelts (such as the hide of a
woolly mammoth or woolly rhinoceros) and wield
huge clubs or spears. Hill giants also can hurl massive
boulders at their enemies.
Although of limited intelligence, many hill giants
prove to be quite clever and resourceful; too, they
speak proto-Keltic and/or the Common tongue.
Typically they are cruel and quite enjoy tormenting
smaller humanoids, such as men. Rare is the kindly,
simpleminded brute, or the gigantic, cowardly sort.
Hill giants oft live solitary lifestyles, though sometimes
a raiding group may be encountered, or a clan dwelling
in a large cavern. For every 8 hill giants there will be
1 chieftain that stands some 15 feet in height and
weighs as much as 2,000 pounds. In Hyperborea,
the Kelts regard hill giants as their enemies of old,
notorious for raiding and pillaging their communities
for slaves and livestock.
Special:
¬¬ Can hurl a boulder to a range of 100 (or to 200 at a
−2 attack penalty) for 2d8 hp damage.
