Dwarfs are a subterranean race of degenerate
humanoids from three to four feet tall, with stubby
legs, heavily muscled torsos, and long, thewy arms.
Seeded by Ymir, they begin life as foot-long, sickly
yellow maggots, “worms of the earth” that at length
metamorphose into horribly misshapen pygmy brutes
(cf. worm of Ymir). They lair in the deepest places of
Underborea, in vast caverns where dwell nameless
monsters. Dwarfs speak the Old Norse language and
(less often) the Common tongue.
Dwarfs are possessed of strange powers and wicked
inclinations. They are cunning, grasping, venal,
and lecherous. Equally they are tireless forgers and
dweomercræfters of nigh limitless capacity, but they are
unable to utilize the weapons and devices they create;
hence, dweomercræft is both their blessing and their
curse. Availability of dwarfish forgings is the purview
of the referee; always their demands for compensation
are greedy or perverse.
Special:
¬¬ +4 bonus to device saves.
¬¬ Can see in complete darkness.
¬¬ −2 attack penalty when exposed to bright light.
