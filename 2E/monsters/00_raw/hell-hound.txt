These large black dogs of the underworld stand four
feet at the shoulder and weigh about 250 pounds. Their
teeth are black, and their baleful eyes hold a flicker
of flames. When they howl, smoke emits from their
muzzles.
These Lawful Evil beasts are
possessed of minor intelligence
and said to have their own
language. Typically they dwell by
volcanoes or steam vents, or in
the depths of a dungeon. Often a
dæmon or other netherworldly
power will control a pack of hell
hounds, though a wicked sorcerer
also might keep one as a pet or
guardian.
Special:
¬¬ 5-in-6 chance to see invisible
opponents.
¬¬ Can breathe fire thrice per day in
a 10-foot-long cone, 5 feet wide at
the terminus, causing 3d6 hp damage
(avoidance save allowed for ½ damage).
