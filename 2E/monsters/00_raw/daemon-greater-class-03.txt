Standing 9–10 feet tall, this horrific, heavily muscled
dæmon has a thick, wrinkled hide and a lupine head
from which project two goat horns. Class III greater
dæmons have four arms. Two are massive and simian,
emerging from the typical shoulder area; these arms
terminate in great homarine pincers. The secondary
set of arms emerges from the pectoral area; these end
in taloned hands. Class III greater dæmons are more
intelligent than their class I or II kin. They dwell in
the world of men because someone (or something) has
beckoned them forth, or because they scheme to effect
Evil.
Special:
¬¬ 9-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For
every CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty
increases by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p. 261: Saving
Throw, spell resistance).
¬¬ Cold, electricity, fire, and gas attacks inflict
½ damage, or ¼ damage if save is made.
¬¬ Can cast the following spells at will (though only
one at a time): cause fear (reverse of remove fear),
darkness, detect invisibility, infrared vision, levitate,
polymorph self, pyrotechnics, telekinesis, teleport
(without error).
¬¬ Once per day, can attempt to beckon another dæmon
to fight alongside it (as reverse of dismissal), with
2-in-6 chance of success; roll 1d3 to determine if
a class I, class II, or class III greater dæmon is
beckoned. Alternatively, it can attempt to summon
1d4 class iii lesser dæmons or 1d3 class iv lesser
dæmons, with 4-in-6 chance of success.
