This arachnidan monstrosity is about 10 feet long
(including tail), with massive pincers, four pairs of
taloned legs, and a great metasoma that is barbed with
a deadly stinger. These nocturnal creatures are black or
yellow in colour and dwell in caves, dungeons, deserts,
steppes, and old ruins. The mother giant scorpion bears
a dozen live young that cling to her for as long as two
weeks.
Special:
¬¬ When sorcerous ultraviolet vision is in effect, a
giant scorpion takes on a phosphorescent glow; all
attacks against it are at a +1 attack bonus.
¬¬ If both pincers hit, stinger attack is made at a +2
bonus on the attack roll.
¬¬ Stinger delivers deadly venom unless death (poison)
save is made, causing immediate loss of speech,
paralysis 1 round later, and death in 2d4 rounds.
