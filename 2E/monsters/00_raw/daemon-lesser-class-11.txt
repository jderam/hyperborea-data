Eight-limbed and with slavering maw, this jet-black
abomination moves with startling speed given its eightfoot
length. Like most lesser dæmons, it is incapable
of true speech, but can mock sounds it has heard with
uncanny accuracy; it favours mimicking small children
and pets to lure victims. Sages aver that these dæmons
dwell in caverns deep beneath the earth, where the
slumbering forms of their victims
hang amongst the stalactites, saved
for some inscrutable purpose.
Special:
¬¬ 5-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For
every CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty
increases by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p. 261: Saving
Throw, spell resistance).
¬¬ Cold, electricity, fire, and gas attacks inflict
½ damage, or ¼ damage if save is made.
¬¬ Bite victim must make death (poison) save or suffer
the effects of a sleep everlasting spell.
¬¬ Can cast ventriloquism at will.
