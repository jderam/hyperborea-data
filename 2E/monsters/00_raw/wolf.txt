The wolf is a wild, carnivorous animal that lives
and hunts in packs. Wolves are found in caves and
wilderness alike; forest species are thinner and longerlimbed,
tundra species stockier and of denser coat.
Captured wolf pups might be trained much as dogs,
though the possibility exists of unfortunate incident
upon maturation. Every pack has an alpha male, which
might be a specimen of maximum hit points.
The dire wolf is a larger, heavier, more ferocious wolf,
as large as five feet at the shoulder and 500 pounds,
seemingly possessed of semi-intelligence. Typically
dire wolves range across most wilderness environs,
though their lairs usually are located in caves. It is said
that abominable snow-men have devised a means
of training these savage animals to pull their war
sleds. Every pack has an alpha male, which might be a
specimen of maximum hit points.
The winter wolf is an Evil, semi-intelligent,
supernatural beast that inhabits the most forbidding
regions. These wolves have pure-white coats, stand
from five to six feet at the shoulder, and weigh as much
as 750 pounds. They can release terrible howls that
discharge blasts of cold, freezing to the bone their prey,
which they then will crush in their horrible jaws. They
are believed to have their own strange language. Winter
wolves fear and loathe the men of Leng, and they leap
in wild, howling fervour when Ythaqqa walks amongst
them or sends his frigid wind.
