A lion is a large, powerful, carnivorous cat able to
thrive in most environments. An adult male typically
measures nearly nine feet long and four feet at the
shoulder, weighing as much as 500 pounds; an adult
female is about one-half to three-quarters this size.
A lion is capable of releasing a powerful roar. They
generally avoid men, but some develop a taste for
human flesh. Usually they hunt in small groups; prides
are larger. N.B.: A pride might comprise 25% cubs.
A mountain lion is a sleek feline long of body and
limbs. This great cat thrives in many regions, not just
mountains; in non-mountain habitats they might be
referred to as cougars or pumas. Adults are six feet long
and weigh 250 pounds. They are protective of their
domain; otherwise they are unlikely to attack men.
Typically a solitary hunter, a mountain lion will hide
under brush and foliage to stalk prey. They are adept
climbers and can leap up to 18 feet.
Special:
¬¬ If a lion hits with both claw attacks, rear claws
automatically rake for 1d6+1 hp damage each.
¬¬ If a mountain lion hits with both claw
attacks, rear claws automatically rake for 1d4+1
hp damage each.
