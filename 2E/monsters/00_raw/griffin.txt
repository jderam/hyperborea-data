This legendary beast is of 10- to 12-foot length (plus tail)
and weighs as much as 800 pounds. It has the head,
wings, and fore claws of a giant eagle, with the body
and hind legs of a large lion. Griffins make their nests
on high cliffs and mountains, attacking any creature
that approaches.
Griffins are notorious predators with a taste for horse
and camel. They might be tamed as pets or flying
mounts if captured as hatchlings; their craving for
horse and camel, however, is inexorable, which can
have unfortunate consequences. The saddle and harness
of a trained griffin cost at least 300 gp to commission.
