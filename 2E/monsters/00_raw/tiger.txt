A tiger is a great striped cat that inhabits the
grasslands and woodlands of Hyperborea. Whitecoated
tigers with black or brown stripes are the norm
in the grasslands and tundra, whereas tigers of yellowbrown
coats and black stripes roam the woodlands.
Adult males typically measure eight feet long (plus tail)
and weigh as much as 650 pounds; adult females are
about three-quarters this size.
A sabre-tooth is an enormous and powerful cat built
for strength; it has short limbs, a thick, powerful
body, and curved canine teeth of 10-inch length. The
hindquarters are striped, the front thickly furred with
spots. Adults measure up to 10 feet long (plus tail)
and 4 feet at the shoulder,
weighing 800 pounds.
Hunters of giant elk, woolly
mammoths, and musk oxen,
these great cats range over
plains and tundra, scarcely
finding men worth their
efforts, but they will attack if
desperate or incited.
The sabre-tooth superior is
the largest of the great cats.
This six-legged beast has stout
limbs and a thick, heavily
muscled back. Adults measure
up to 12 feet long (plus tail)
and 5 feet at the shoulder,
weighing 1,200 pounds. Their
coats are tan and spotted,
and their canine teeth are 12 inches long. These are the
most feared predators of the Hyperborean steppes,
taking down the largest herbivores—as well as other
carnivores. Usually they ignore men, unless desperate
or threatened. They typically rear up on their hind legs
when fighting, rending with their front four claws.
Special (all):
¬¬ All tigers are superior stalkers; chance to surprize
increased by 2-in-6.
Special (tiger and sabre-tooth):
¬¬ If both claw attacks hit, the cat automatically rakes
with its two rear claws for 2d4 hp damage each.
