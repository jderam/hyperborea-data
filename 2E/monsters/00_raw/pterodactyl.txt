These pterosaurs have long, slender heads and necks,
with short tails. Their bat-like, membranous wings
span 20–30 feet, and their beaks are lined with sharp
teeth. Hyperborean pterodactyls are thick with downy
feathers, which can range from white to grey to dun.
Pterodactyls are agile and skilled fliers and will swarm
to prey, though they are not averse to scavenging. These
beasts typically build their eyries near active volcanoes
and also at the Rim of the World, where volcanic
islands present a more hospitable climate. Rare are the
pterodactyls seen above the
cold wastes of mainland
Hyperborea, but they
will hunt the forests,
grasslands,
and swamps.
