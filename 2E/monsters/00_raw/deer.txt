Red deer have a coat of red in the four years of summer,
or grey in the other nine years of the 13-year Hyperborean
cycle. They stand from three to four feet at the shoulder
and weigh 250–350 pounds. They flee from most
everything, though a cornered hart can butt with its
antlers.
Reindeer are larger, standing four or more feet at the
shoulder and weighing as much as 400 pounds. Too,
the spread of their antlers is much larger, and they are
generally furrier, thriving in tundra regions. Reindeer are
herded by Esquimaux, utilized for their meat, milk, and
hides. They can be domesticated and trained in teams to
pull sleds. Some nomadic Esquimaux, particularly those
with strains of Lapp in their blood, are known also to
saddle and ride reindeer.
Giant elk are an enormous species of deer with the
largest spread of antlers in all of Hyperborea. They stand
10 feet at the shoulder, weigh as much as 3,000 pounds,
and present an antler spread of as much as 15 feet. In
forests, plains, tundra, and wetlands, solitary stags or a
sibling pair may be encountered, as well as small herds.
Generally giant elk avoid conflict—they merely will
bristle their fur, snort, and face down potential threats—
but some bucks can be uncharacteristically violent during
mating season. N.B.: Though most giant elk are brown of
fur, the rare white stag is a prized hunting trophy; in some
cultures it is venerated as a holy creature,
oft associated with Yoon’Deh.
