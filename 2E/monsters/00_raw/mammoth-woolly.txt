The woolly mammoth is the only member of the
elephant family known to thrive in Hyperborea. Woolly
mammoths are massive, lumbering beasts up to 15
feet at the shoulder and weighing as much as 14,000
pounds. They have thick, shaggy fur and enormous,
yellow tusks as long as 15 feet.
If raised from a calf, a mammoth can be used as a
beast of burden; in Hyperborea, mammoths pull great
waggons with wheels eight feet high. They also can
be used in war, driven by trained riders to trample
enemy troops. When encountered in the wild, woolly
mammoths are either solitary or in family groups, but
when the great herds gather, hundreds will assemble.
In Hyperborea’s remotest regions dwells the woolly
mammoth superior. It stands some 18 feet at the
shoulder and has four great tusks. These intractable
beasts cannot be tamed and will chase down men on
sight.
N.B.: Mammoth ivory is prized by some cultures, and
tusks can fetch 100–600 gp apiece.
Special:
¬¬ Every time mammoths are struck for damage, they
may go berserk on a 2-in-6 chance, attacking at +2
to attack and damage rolls for the remainder of
the fight (and equally dangerous to their human
masters, if applicable).
¬¬ A bull in musth is always in a berserk state, as
above; furthermore, it has ML 12 and relentlessly
will pursue its target(s).
