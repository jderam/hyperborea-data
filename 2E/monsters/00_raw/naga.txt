This monster has the 20-foot-long body of a python,
surmounted by the head of a disturbingly ugly woman
with fangs for teeth and a shock of tangled, whitestreaked
hair. Nagas are the servants of otherworldly
powers, typically assigned to guard some place of
religious significance; some sages posit that these
guardians originally were created by the weird science
of snake-men. Nagas are cruel and relentless creatures,
possessed of keen intelligence and cunning trickery. In
their sibilant tongue they sing haunting melodies to
raise the hackles of any man.
Special:
¬¬ Singing voice once per day can charm 1d6 victims
of 6 or fewer HD, unless sorcery saves are made;
the saves are modified by willpower adjustment (see
Vol. I, p. 9: Attributes, wisdom), if applicable.
Charmed individuals stand dumbly, allowing naga
to do as it will—even kill them.
¬¬ Bite delivers venom; make death (poison) save or
suffer paralysis for 1d6+6 turns.
¬¬ On successful bite attack (whether or not paralysis
results), monster enwraps and constricts its victim
for additional 2d4 hp damage
per round. The naga can squeeze
one victim to death whilst
continuing to bite other targets.
To escape constriction, victim
must make an extraordinary feat
of strength or dexterity (see Vol.
I, p. 7: Attributes, strength and
dexterity). Otherwise, allies whose
strength totals at least 60 may
pull the victim free.
¬¬ A naga has the sorcery ability of
a 6th-level cleric. The referee can
select spells accordingly
(3 × level 1, 2 × level 2,
2 × level 3), or use the
following default selections:
÷÷ Level 1: command, cure light
wounds, protection from good
÷÷ Level 2: darkness, hold person
÷÷ Level 3: dispel magic, inflict
blindness
¬¬ N.B.: As the naga frequently is
charged with the protection of a
place, often it will place a glyph of
warding thereabouts.
