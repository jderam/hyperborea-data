The blue whale is the largest marine mammal of
Hyperborea. It reaches lengths of 100 or more feet
and has speckled blue-grey or white skin. It feeds on
krill and will not seek human prey, but might swallow
a lone swimmer if hungry enough. If harpooned the
blue whale can be quite deadly, overturning the largest
vessels. Typically they feed in the shallow waters of
coastal Hyperborea and breed near the Rim of the
World.
The killer whale is a black and white hunter of the
sea, up to 30 feet long and weighing as much as 30,000
pounds. Killer whales (orcas) prey on fish, mammals,
and other whales. Of course, they will devour men, too.
The narwhale is a grey, spotted, 20-foot-long mammal
prized for its great spiral horn of from 8- to 10-foot
length (valued at 2,000 gp), found only on the males of
the species. Peaceful and intelligent, these “unicorns
of the sea” scour glacial waters for prey and will
molest a man only if threatened—except in the case of
fish-men, which they attack on sight. Narwhales are
believed to communicate via telepathy.
Special (blue whale):
¬¬ If bite attack hits by a margin of 4 or more (or on a
natural 20 in any case), victim is swallowed whole,
inflicting 1d6 hp damage per round thereafter; after
3 rounds, the victim may asphyxiate (see Vol. III,
p. 263: Special Damage, asphyxia). Swallowed
prey can cut its way out with a WC 1–3 blade, with
an attack penalty equal to the weapon class. If 20
hp damage is inflicted from within, a large enough
rent is cut for escape.
Special (killer whale):
¬¬ On a natural 20 attack roll, a Small or Medium

damage per round thereafter; after 3 rounds,
the victim may asphyxiate (see Vol. III, p. 263:
Special Damage, asphyxia). Swallowed prey can
cut its way out with a WC 1–3 blade, with an attack
penalty equal to the weapon class. If 20 hp damage
is inflicted from within, a large enough rent is cut
for escape.
Special (narwhale):
¬¬ If incited (e.g., pups threatened), can deliver
a charge attack (see Vol. III, p. 249: Combat
Actions, melee) for treble damage dice (6d6).
