Cyclopes are a race of giant, one-eyed humanoids,
typically standing 20 feet in height. They savour the
flesh of men, taking exceptional pleasure in cruelty and
torment. The cyclops’ single eye is large and centred in
the middle of its forehead. Some present horned heads
as well, typically with a single horn, but sometimes
with two. Typically cyclopes will fight with massive
clubs or spears, though they are also expert rock
hurlers.
Cyclopes usually live alone or in small family
groups, oft in a cave or on an island. Although of low
intelligence and naïve to the tricks of men, they can
raise cattle and grow vegetables. Most speak a proto-
Hellenic dialect and/or the Common tongue.
Special:
¬¬ Can hurl a boulder to a range of 100 (or to 200 at a
−2 penalty) for 3d8 hp damage.
