Appearing as a somewhat manlike figure of ghastly
white fungoid composition, this creature exudes a
strong odour of earth and loam. It speaks Common in
a hollow voice that seems to emanate from the very
depths of the earth. Because of their vast knowledge of
things subterranean (including buried treasures), these
dæmons oft are summoned by those seeking after such
prizes. They invariably will demand a blood price in
return for their aid.
Special:
¬¬ 4-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For
every CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty
increases by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p. 261: Saving
Throw, spell resistance).
¬¬ Cold, electricity, fire, and gas
attacks inflict ½
damage, or ¼
damage if save
is made.
¬¬ Any wood that contacts this dæmon will rot
instantly and fall to pieces; wooden magic items
are allowed class 5 item saves to avoid destruction
(see Vol. III, p. 260: Saving Throw, item saving
throws).
¬¬ Any creature struck must make a death (poison)
save or contract a form of leprosy that proves fatal
in 1d6 weeks.
¬¬ May use legend lore at will, but only for matters
related to the earth and subterranean locales;
results are immediate (not 1d10 days later).
