The hyæna is a carnivorous, doglike animal noted
for its coarse, spotted fur and powerful jaws, but
most famous for its weird and haunting howl, which
resembles the hysterical laughter of a man. Hyænas
are notorious scavengers, able to sniff out carrion from
several miles away. Typically they will not attack men
unless desperate.
The giant hyæna (hyænodon) is five feet at the shoulder
and weighs as much as 1,000 pounds. Giant hyænas
have long, narrow skulls and massive teeth for
crushing bones. As their smaller cousins, they can emit
disconcerting howls, not unlike the bawling of a man
suffering. These creatures are oft at odds with sabretooths,
competing for the same prey. Accounts speak
of giant hyænas guarding ruined shrines to Xathoqqua.
