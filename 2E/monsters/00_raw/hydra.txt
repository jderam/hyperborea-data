A hydra is the scaly serpent of legendry, with five, seven,
or nine serpentine heads (1 per HD) of from 8- to 10-foot
length—heads that regenerate if severed—at one end of
its 30-foot, ophidian body. These beasts oftest are solitary
and found in any environment, the colour of their scales
corresponding thusly.
Aqua-hydræ are the aquatic species found in lakes,
swamps, marshes, or the sea. Each has two great flippers
and a fluked tail. The most impressive deep-sea specimens
are venerated by fish-men; indeed, sages posit the
legendary fish-man deity Mother Hydra is an aqua-hydra
of prodigious size.
Pyro-hydræ are legless terrestrial monsters, with scales
of orange to reddish colour banded in pink and yellow.
These mythic beasts breathe fire and oft are deemed sacred
by religiously inclined pyromancer cults. They lair in
deserts and mountains and oft breed in volcanoes.
Special (aqua-hydra):
¬¬ Each head has its own 7 hp; if destroyed, it regenerates
to full health in 3 rounds.
¬¬ Venomous bite; make death (poison) save or suffer 2d6
hp damage. Wound infected unless cure disease cast,
causing fever and nausea (for 1d8 days), then coma (for
2d8 days), and finally death. (Multiple bites are not
cumulative). Each head can deliver venom once per day.
Special (pyro-hydra):
¬¬ Immune to fire.
¬¬ Vulnerable to cold: +2 hp per die of damage.
¬¬ Each head can breathe fire once per day in a cone 25
feet long and 10 feet wide at its terminus, delivering
2d6 hp damage (per head); an avoidance save is allowed
for ½ damage.
¬¬ Each head has its own 7 hp; if destroyed, it regenerates
to full health in 3 rounds.
