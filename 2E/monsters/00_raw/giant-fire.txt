In the unfathomable depths of
Underborea dwell the sons of
Muspelheim, fire giants of enormous
size and girth. They stand some 16
or more feet tall and weigh as much
as 2,000 pounds. Their eyes are
black as coals; their beards, dark and
thick; and their skin, red as blood.
Fire giants speak Old Norse and the
Common tongue. In futility the fire
giants of Underborea make offerings
to Surtr, but that one no longer hears
their cries; hence, many of these forsaken humanoids
have found Thaumagorga, and to that underworld
dæmon they pay tribute and make supplications.
Dwarfs are a slave race to fire giants, and under the
whips of their dark masters they forge wonders of
copper, iron, and steel; fire giants oft gird themselves in
copper armour of dwarfish manufacture. They dwell in
castles of iron and stone surrounded by moats of magma,
where they are served by fire salamanders and pyrohydræ.
A large fire giant stronghold is ruled by a jarl
(1 for every 12 fire giants), a 20-foot-tall, 3,000-pound fire
giant of great power and horribly violent temperament.
