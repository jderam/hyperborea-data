The wolverine is a stocky, short-legged, carnivorous
mammal known for its dark, shaggy coat and bushy
tail. (These are remarkable for their lighter-coloured
bands; hence the coat can be of value to hunters.)
Typical wolverines in Hyperborea are about four feet
long and weigh as much as 70 pounds. They are robust
creatures of nasty temperament, with semi-retractable
claws and powerful teeth, and they carry an odious
musk stench.
Wolverines are held to possess intelligence slightly
above that of other animals. They dwell in boreal forests
and tundra regions, hunting deer, elk, and even other
predators. They chase down their prey, pounce on it, and
drag it to the ground. A wolverine will attack a man on
sight.
The giant wolverine is a bearlike beast that measures up
to six feet long and three feet at the shoulder, weighing
as much as 400 pounds. In addition to the prey noted
above, a giant wolverine will hunt musk oxen and even
small woolly mammoths. Giant wolverines are beasts of
higher intelligence, capable of speech and aligned with
Chaotic Evil.
