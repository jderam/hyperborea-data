Automata are humanoid constructs of mad sorcerers
and their ilk, the formulæ for the creation of
which trace back to a bygone age when Atlanteans,
Hyperboreans, and Lemurians commingled sorcery
and science. Strange wires, conduits, batteries, cells,
and circuits are installed in many of these creations,
though no two manuals of automaton creation (see
Vol. V, p. 482: Magical Treasure, miscellaneous
magic items) describe precisely identical processes;
alternative methods of creation were engendered by the
ancients, but this is a lost science in rapidly decaying
Hyperborea.
A bronze automaton is a massive 10-foot construct
built to resemble a minotaur. A typical bronze
automaton is fashioned to wield a great spear, halberd,
or trident, composed entirely of bronze. The bronze
automaton is ever obedient and under the command of
its creator, though it only responds to clear and loudly
vocalized commands. N.B.: The golden heart of a felled
bronze automaton, if extracted, has a 12,000-gp value.
A clay automaton is a manlike statue eight feet tall.
The clay automaton is under its creator’s command;
typically the creature is appointed a task, such as
guardianship. N.B.: Clay automata are prone to
possession by dæmons.
A flesh automaton is built from the corpses of at least
five men. Though the creature is impervious to most
harm (unless magical), the creator might yet gird his
golem in armour. The flesh automaton obeys the will
of its creator; commands must be simple, for the brute
retains limited intelligence.
An iron
automaton is
a 12-foot iron
statue. Most
are moulded
bearing a
weapon, such
as an enormous
sword or
axe. The iron
automaton
is under the
command of its
creator.
A stone automaton is a 10-foot-tall statue chiselled
from granite or marble, oft with the likeness of a
sword or an axe in hand. Stone automata are the least
intelligent type, able to comprehend seven simple
commands, which must be programmed during the
creation process. Typical commands include “Attack!”,
“Capture!”, “Follow!”, “Stop!”, and “Wait!” Ambiguous
commands such as “Guard!” may be misunderstood;
the monster might guard a place instead of a person,
even if a person was the intent.
Special (all):
¬¬ +1 or better weapon to hit.
Special (bronze automaton):
¬¬ Immune to sorcery, except lightning, which
functions as slow spell for 3 rounds.
¬¬ Fire attacks heal the monster instead of damaging
it.
¬¬ Can deliver charging gore attack at +2 bonus and
double damage.
Special (clay automaton):
¬¬ Immune to sorcery, except for disintegrate and
transmute rock to mud, either of which necessitates a
death save or the creature is destroyed.
¬¬ Unharmed by edged or pointed weapons; only
blunt magical weapons (flail, hammer, mace, etc.)
are effective.
¬¬ Damage from its attacks cannot be healed, save by
the sorcery of a cleric or priest of 9th level or greater;
otherwise, damage inflicted is permanent.
Special (flesh automaton):
¬¬ Immune to charm, hold, sleep, and other mindaffecting
sorcery.
¬¬ Electrical attacks heal the monster instead of
damaging it.
¬¬ 1-in-10 chance per round of combat that creature
loses control, attempting to kill all in sight. It
attacks berserkly at +2 to attack and damage
rolls and then flees after 2d6 rounds. It thereafter
will wander aimlessly, avoiding civilization;
rehabilitation is no simple matter. Some flesh
automata are said to manifest rudimentary
intelligence and emotion after such episodes.
Special (iron automaton):
¬¬ Immune to sorcery, except lightning, which
functions as slow spell for 3 rounds.
¬¬ Fire attacks heal the monster instead of damaging
it.
¬¬ Every 7 rounds, can breathe poison gas cloud of
10-cubic-foot volume, as the cloudkill spell.
Special (stone automaton):
¬¬ Immune to sorcery, except stone to flesh (renders
creature AC 8 and vulnerable to normal weapons
for 1d4 rounds) and transmute rock to mud (functions
as slow spell for 2d6 rounds).
