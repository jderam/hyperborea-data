Of grisly leonine form with blood-red hide and mane of
fire, this dæmon is fully as large as a man. It can track
faultlessly when a quarry is named, but otherwise will
destroy and devour living creatures wherever it finds
them. Nothing hidden can escape its burning gaze.
Similar but superior to class v lesser dæmons, these
more cunning beasts frequently are called upon by
sorcerers to find and slay their enemies.
Special:
¬¬ At all times, has the power of a true seeing spell.
¬¬ Can track in any environment at 11-in-12 chance of
success (see Vol. I, p. 26: Fighter Subclasses,
barbarian). Prey warded by a protection from evil spell
cannot be tracked.
¬¬ 4-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For
every CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty
increases by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p. 261: Saving
Throw, spell resistance).
¬¬ Cold, electricity, fire, and gas attacks inflict
½ damage, or ¼ damage if save is made.
¬¬ Once per day, may roar and cause fear (as the spell)
to all within 20 feet.
