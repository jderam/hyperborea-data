* Applies to lacedons only.
This is a repugnant humanoid, once a man, now cursed
with undeath. It has ulcerous skin, pallid or tenebrous,
and its hair is knotted and clumped. Its hands are
gnarled and clawed, and its teeth broken, jagged fangs.
Ghouls have an insatiable appetite for raw human flesh
and are wont to prowl graveyards, unearthing fresh
corpses to take their provender. They retain wicked
quasi-intelligence, exhibiting a flock mentality whilst
hunting in packs.
N.B.: An aquatic form called a lacedon also is extant.
These undead creatures conform to ghouls in all
respects, save that they lurk underwater (salt or fresh).
Some exhibit a more glaucous complexion.
Special:
¬¬ Immune to poison, paralysis, fear, and cold.
¬¬ Protection from evil holds them at bay.
¬¬ Hit causes paralysis for 2d6 turns unless death save
is made.
¬¬ Slain victims later become ghouls.
