A rat is a largish rodent with a pointed snout and
a long, hairless tail. Two varieties are extant in
Hyperborea: one with brown fur, the other black. Rats
are from one to two feet long (plus tail), are aggressive
when hungry, and will attack men if desperate. A giant
rat measures about three feet long (plus tail) and
weighs as much as 60 pounds. These vermin are ofter
found in dungeons, though they might plague cities.
Special:
¬¬ 1-in-6 chance to infect victim with disease upon
successful hit, unless death (poison) save is made.
If save fails, victim either dies in 1d6 days after
suffering fevers and delusion, or is bedridden for a
month with pain and fever. Roll a d6: On a score of
1–2 (rats) or 1–3 (giant rats), the disease is terminal;
otherwise the non-deadly strain is contracted.
