These solid-hoofed, herbivorous mammals oft are
domesticated and trained. Typically they have long,
flowing tails and manes and (in Hyperborea) thick,
shaggy coats. Many breeds exist and are classified in
general terms.
A donkey is a domesticated ass that stands about
four feet at the shoulder and has thick, shaggy fur.
Donkeys are renowned for their loud braying. A mule
is a cross betwixt a male donkey and a mare (female
horse); these creatures are similar to donkeys, though
generally hardier. A pony is a diminutive horse of
approximately 12 hands height (about four feet at the
shoulder), covered with shaggy fur. Ponies are of even
temperament and can be led through cramped tunnels.
A draught horse is the largest, bred for power and
endurance to pull a plough or waggon. Horses of
draught-quality breed run wild on the Hyperborean
plains; 1-in-10 might be suited to become a warhorse, if
raised from a foal.
A warhorse is bred for strength, power, and the ability
to charge into battle. Non-warhorses must make
morale checks each round they are urged to take part
in combat. If they fail, they will try to flee and possibly
throw their riders.
A riding horse is smaller and lighter-boned than a
draught horse, but capable of bearing a rider for great
distances. Wild horses of riding horse quality run free
on the Hyperborean plains. Wild foals may be tamed,
though the older the horse, the less likely this prospect
becomes.
Special (all horses):
¬¬ Horses (but not donkeys, mules, or ponies) can
treble their movement rates in short bursts.
