This is the wild and pure-hearted beast of legendry,
the winged horse. Originally birthed from the spilled
blood of a beheaded gorgon (Medusa), these bashful
creatures typically avoid contact. Pegasuses are wise,
compassionate creatures scarcely found in the cruel
reaches of Hyperborea. They cannot be tamed by
mortal men, and nearly all attempts have been met by
disaster—the exceptions being veteran paladins pure
of heart who quest for the beasts as sacred mounts
(and the rarer still cataphract deemed worthy by the
pegasus).
