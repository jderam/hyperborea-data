Unspeakably cruel and domineering, this six-armed
dæmon has the lower body of a reticulated snake,
surmounted by the naked, curvaceous torso of a woman
with a hauntingly beautiful face. Often these dæmons
adorn themselves in jewellery of no less than 2,000-
gp value. Class V greater dæmons stand from seven to
eight feet tall, though their tails can extend to a length
of 15–20 feet. With their six long arms they wield steel
scimitars.
Less powerful dæmons—even class IV—rightly
fear class V greater dæmons, for they are incredibly
intelligent and manipulative. In netherworldly realms
such as Underborea, they are served by hosts of class I,
II, and III greater dæmons—and perhaps one or more
class IV greater dæmons. Only the most powerful (or
foolish) of sorcerers would dare beckon a class V greater
dæmon.
Special:
¬¬ 12-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For
every CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty
increases by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p. 261: Saving
Throw, spell resistance).
¬¬ Cold, electricity, fire, and gas attacks inflict
½ damage, or ¼ damage if save is made.
¬¬ +1 or better weapon to hit.
¬¬ All attack rolls made at +2 bonus.
¬¬ Can cast the following spells at will (though only
one at a time): cause fear (reverse of remove fear),
charm person, darkness (20-ft. radius), decipher
language, detect invisibility, infrared vision, levitate,
polymorph self, project image, pyrotechnics, teleport
(without error).
¬¬ Once per day, can attempt to beckon another dæmon
to fight alongside it (as reverse of dismissal), with
3-in-6 chance of success; roll 1d12: On a 1–3, a class
I greater dæmon is beckoned; on a 4–6, a class
II greater dæmon; on a 7–8, a class III greater
dæmon; on a 9–10, a class IV greater dæmon;
on an 11, a class V greater dæmon; and on a
roll of 12, a class VI greater dæmon is beckoned.
Alternatively, it can attempt to summon 1d4 class
iv lesser dæmons or 1d3 class vi lesser dæmons,
with 5-in-6 chance of success.
