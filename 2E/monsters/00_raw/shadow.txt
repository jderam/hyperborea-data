These intelligent, incorporeal undead creatures dwell
in the illimitable depths of the Black Gulf, though
are known to enter Hyperborea; sometimes they are
conjured. They appear as humanoid shadows (such as
that which might be cast behind a man under a gibbous
moon), though they can alter their shapes. Hateful and
malicious, these extra-dimensional creatures enjoy
draining men of their vitality, transforming their
victims into fellow shadows.
Special:
¬¬ Chance to surprize
increased by 2-in-6 against most
opponents.
¬¬ Immune to poison,
paralysis, fear, and
cold.
¬¬ Harmed
only by silver or
magical weapons.
¬¬ Drains 1
point of strength
on successful hit,
a weakness that
lasts 1d6+4 turns. Any
creature drained to 0
ST becomes a shadow
in thrall to the one that
transformed him, and
likewise does he become
utterly hateful of all corporeal
creatures.
