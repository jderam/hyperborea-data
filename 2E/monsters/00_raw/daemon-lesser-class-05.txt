Appearing somewhat as a grisly, hairless hound with
powerful rear legs and rudimentary hands instead
of front paws, this dæmon is a faultless tracker and
tireless pursuer. It is cunning enough to focus on its
quarry and not raise alarm through senseless carnage. If
no prey has been designated, this dæmon will run amok
much like its brethren. Sorcerers have been known to
summon these beasts as trackers and killers, though care
need be taken lest they turn on their masters.
Special:
¬¬ Can track in any environment at 11-in-12 chance of
success (see Vol. I, p. 26: Fighter Subclasses,
barbarian). Prey warded by a protection from evil spell
cannot be tracked.
¬¬ Can hide and move silently at 11-in-12 chance of
success (see Vol. I, pp. 21–23: Classes, thief).
¬¬ 2-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For
every CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty
increases by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p. 261: Saving
Throw, spell resistance).
¬¬ Cold, electricity, fire, and gas attacks inflict
½ damage, or ¼ damage if save is made.
¬¬ Once per day, can vomit a 10-foot stream of acid
that causes damage equal to the dæmon’s current
hit points (avoidance save for ½ damage).
