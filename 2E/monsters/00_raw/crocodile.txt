Crocodiles are semi-aquatic, predatory reptiles with
long jaws and tails, short legs, and horny, textured skin.
Often they dwell in or near water (fresh or salt) and will
submerse themselves so as to sneak up on prey. Typical
specimens are of about 20-foot length. In Hyperborea,
crocodiles scarcely are found about the main continent;
they inhabit the tropical isles at the Rim of the World.
Giant crocodiles of 50-foot length lurk in the sea,
though sometimes in coastal marshlands. They are
notorious for tearing open the hulls of ships.
Special (crocodile):
¬¬ On any successful bite that delivers 9+ hp damage,
a crocodile holds its victim and goes into a death
spin, causing an additional 3d4 hp damage per
round. In water waist deep or greater, the victim
risks drowning (see Vol. III, p. 263: Special
Damage, asphyxia). Escaping a death spin requires
an extraordinary feat of strength (see Vol. I, p. 7:
Attributes, strength).
Special (giant crocodile):
¬¬ On a natural 19 or 20 attack roll, the giant crocodile
swallows its victim whole, inflicting 1d6 hp damage
per round thereafter; after 3 rounds, the victim may
asphyxiate (see Vol. III, p. 263: Special Damage,
asphyxia). Swallowed prey can cut its way out with
a WC 1–3 blade, with an attack penalty equal to
the weapon class. If 12 hp damage is inflicted from
within, a large enough rent is cut for escape.
