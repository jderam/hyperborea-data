Perhaps the strangest of all dæmons in appearance,
this entity manifests as a sickly blue globe ringed with
glaring red eyes, which creeps about on a mass of livid
purple tentacles. It can converse in any language via
its tongues ability, in a buzzing inhuman voice that
wounds the soul. Sorcerers oft summon these beasts
for questioning, as they possess great wisdom, but the
dæmons prefer to reveal secrets that will cause misery
and suffering for as many living things as possible.
Special:
¬¬ 6-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For
every CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty
increases by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p. 261: Saving
Throw, spell resistance).
¬¬ Cold, electricity, fire, and gas attacks inflict
½ damage, or ¼ damage if save is made.
¬¬ Harmed only by silver or magical weapons.
¬¬ Can cast the following spells at will (though only
one at a time): contact otherworldly being (no chance
of insanity), legend lore, tongues.
