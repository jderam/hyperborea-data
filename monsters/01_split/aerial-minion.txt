This species of air elemental is a semi-intelligent
creature conjured by clerics or cryomancers of no small
power (see Vol. II, p. 210: Spells: S, summon aerial
minion). These creatures are naturally invisible; even
if revealed (by sorcery or otherwise), they appear as
dim, nebulous shapes of eight-foot height somewhat
conforming to anthropoid dimensions. When bound to
service they will not fight, for their function is to find
and retrieve; they are strong and quick, able to bear
as much as 1,000 pounds and move unencumbered. If
bidden to retrieve a creature of Small or Medium size,
the aerial minion will attempt to seize its quarry with
force (a grapple attempt; see Vol. III, p. 248: Combat
Actions, melee). Typically an aerial minion attacks
only when it must defend itself, or if it is bewildered
by its assignment, the latter case causing it to become
insane and return to kill its summoner.
Special:
¬¬ Can follow any trail no more
than two weeks old.
¬¬ Natural invisibility grants
3-in-6 bonus to surprize and
+4 bonus to all attack rolls. If
a target is not surprized, his
hackles will rise, perceiving
the unseen threat, but +4
attack bonus remains.
¬¬ An attacker with true seeing
or like means to penetrate
invisibility receives a +4 attack
bonus versus an aerial minion.
¬¬ Destroyed by dispel magic
versus the summoner’s CA.
¬¬ Only an extraordinary feat
of strength (see Vol. I, p. 7:
Attributes, strength) can
break creature’s hold if grapple
is established.
¬¬ Goes insane and attacks
summoner if unable to
complete mission, typically
if confused by objective or if
spell’s duration expires.
