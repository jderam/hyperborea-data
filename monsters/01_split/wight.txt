This dreadful creature is formed when a negativeenergy
spirit inhabits a cadaver. The result is an undead
thing that feeds on positive energy (i.e., life). Pallid of
countenance, with long, talon-like nails and broken,
jagged teeth, wights walk with a stoop and carry the
stench of death and decay. They never desist from
attempting to feed.
Special:
¬¬ Immune to poison, paralysis, fear, and cold.
¬¬ Harmed only by silver or magical weapons.
¬¬ Touch drains 1 level of experience unless a
death save is made (see Vol. III, p. 263: Special
Damage, energy drain).
