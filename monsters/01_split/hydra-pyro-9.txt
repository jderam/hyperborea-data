A hydra is the scaly serpent of legendry, with five, seven,
or nine serpentine heads (1 per HD) of from 8- to 10-foot
length—heads that regenerate if severed—at one end of
its 30-foot, ophidian body. These beasts oftest are solitary
and found in any environment, the colour of their scales
corresponding thusly.
Pyro-hydræ are legless terrestrial monsters, with scales
of orange to reddish colour banded in pink and yellow.
These mythic beasts breathe fire and oft are deemed sacred
by religiously inclined pyromancer cults. They lair in
deserts and mountains and oft breed in volcanoes.
Special:
¬¬ Immune to fire.
¬¬ Vulnerable to cold: +2 hp per die of damage.
¬¬ Each head can breathe fire once per day in a cone 25
feet long and 10 feet wide at its terminus, delivering
2d6 hp damage (per head); an avoidance save is allowed
for ½ damage.
¬¬ Each head has its own 7 hp; if destroyed, it regenerates
to full health in 3 rounds.
