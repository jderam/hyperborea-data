These humanoid creatures are composed of hardpacked
dirt, sand, and rock. Resembling roughly
hewn statues, their steps are thunderous, and they
can pummel foes with their enormous fists. In general
they are as tall in feet as their HD, so an 8-HD earth
elemental is about eight feet tall.
Special:
¬¬ +1 or better weapon to hit.
¬¬ Inflicts an extra 1d8 hp damage versus opponents
standing on earth or stone.
¬¬ Complete water immersion will dissolve an earth
elemental in 1d6 turns, unless it makes a death save,
in which case it will lose half its current hit points.
