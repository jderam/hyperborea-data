These unseen, eight-foot-tall, extra-dimensional beings
of quasi-humanoid form typically are conjured by
sorcerers (see Vol. II, p. 213: Spells: S, summon invisible
stalker). Whether they are a form of air elemental
or some other netherworldly spirit is a matter of
conjecture. Once bound to service they are fearless
combatants and flawless trackers, albeit resentful.
Special:
¬¬ Can follow any trail no more than two weeks old.
¬¬ Natural invisibility grants 3-in-6 bonus to surprize
and +4 bonus to all attack rolls. If a target is not
surprized, his hackles will rise, perceiving the
unseen threat, but +4 attack bonus remains.
¬¬ An attacker with true seeing or like means to
penetrate invisibility receives a +4 attack bonus
versus an invisible stalker.
¬¬ Destroyed by dispel magic versus the summoner’s
CA.
