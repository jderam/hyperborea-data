The wolf is a wild, carnivorous animal that lives
and hunts in packs. Wolves are found in caves and
wilderness alike; forest species are thinner and longerlimbed,
tundra species stockier and of denser coat.
Captured wolf pups might be trained much as dogs,
though the possibility exists of unfortunate incident
upon maturation. Every pack has an alpha male, which
might be a specimen of maximum hit points.
