These runtish, vaguely humanoid beings stand from
three to four feet tall. They have broad, flat heads (sans
noses) and large, reptilian eyes that scarcely blink.
They are hairless, and their pale, mottled skin ripples
like the segments of a worm. Their arms are long,
with oversized, club-like fists; their legs are short and
stubby.
Worms of Ymir are subterranean creatures. Some have
burrowed to the infernal depths of Underborea, where
dæmons dwell. Others ever lurk close to the surface,
emerging under the cloak of night to perform nefarious
deeds, causing hardship and misery to mankind.
The origin of this vile species is mired in conjecture.
Viking skalds say that they are the failed progeny of
Ymir: maggots that failed to metamorphose to dwarfs,
trapped in some intermediate stage of development.
Thus they refer to them as worms of Ymir.
Pictish wise men maintain a different opinion. They
refer to this species as worms of the dirt, a hated enemy
race of men against whom they warred for untold
centuries. Ultimately, the Picts drove their adversaries
to the bowels of the earth, and there they devolved to
their current state, wallowing in clay and burrowing
like moles.
Special:
¬¬ Infrared vision (as the spell) to 120-foot range.
¬¬ −2 attack penalty when exposed to bright light.
¬¬ Group mind; multiple worms of Ymir share an
uncanny empathetic connexion, able to move and
react as one.
