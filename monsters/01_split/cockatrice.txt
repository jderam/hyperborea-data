These small, magical creatures appear to be nothing
more than large roosters at first glance; their
serpentine, reticulated tails of some two-foot length,
however, betray them as
something else.
Too, their flight ability far outmatches that of a normal
cock, their aerial speed significant. Despite their small
size, their beaks are quite powerful, rending flesh
as efficiently as a spear, and with deadly sorcerous
consequences—for their touch (much like that of the
basilisk) can turn one to stone.
Special:
¬¬ On a successful hit, victim must make
transformation save or be turned to stone.
