This semi-intelligent elemental manifests as a
standing wave of bubbling water, with dæmonic eyes
and frowning mouth at the centre of its bulk. Water
elementals are as tall in feet as their HD, their width
is ×1.5 their HD, and their depth (or thickness) is half
their HD; thus an 8-HD specimen is 8 feet tall, 12 feet
wide, and 4 feet thick. They attack by slamming against
their opponents. These elementals must always remain
within 90 feet of a water source (e.g., pond, stream,
well).
Special:
¬¬ +1 or better weapon to hit.
¬¬ Inflicts an extra 1d8 hp damage versus foes in water
at least ankle deep.
¬¬ If removed more than 90 feet from water source,
death is instantaneous.
