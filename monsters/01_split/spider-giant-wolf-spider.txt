The giant wolf spider is a nine-foot-long arachnid
that thrives in various environs. Aggressive hunters,
these spiders are notorious for chasing down prey
and pouncing on it after emerging from trees, or from
under rocks or shrubs. They are brownish in colour,
with long, stout, hairy legs and four pairs of eyes, one
set being much larger than the others. They have large,
powerful jaws with paralytic venom. A female might
be seen carrying on its back a large, grey-white silk sac
filled with hundreds of eggs.
N.B.: Whether it be the result of foul sorcery or
dæmonic corruption, intelligent giant wolf spiders are
reputed to exist, almost always female. These talking
spiders are Evil creatures that derive sadistic pleasure
in cruelty, and some exhibit a lust for treasure. Often
they are bound to the task of guardianship of a place or
thing.
