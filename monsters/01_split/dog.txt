Canine-like blink dogs originate from realms
Æthereal. They thrive in cold deserts, hunting in
packs and competing with other carnivores. Although
not physically imposing, they compensate via their
intelligence and supernatural ability to blink (teleport
short distances).
Blink dogs stand from two to three feet at the
shoulder, with furry white legs and thick golden
coats, sometimes spotted brown. They do not bark;
rather they communicate by means of a complex
howling language, though some sages posit that they
possess empathy or telepathy. Blink dogs are thought
to comport to a strict moral code, suggested by their
apparent opposition to Chaotic Evil creatures of
otherworldly origins. Their packs are believed to be
matriarchal.
Hunting dogs include several domesticated canine
species that can be trained to a variety of tasks, such
as fetching a bird or pursuing a rabbit from a burrow;
others are utilized strictly for their ability to track prey.
Sled dogs are thick-furred animals, able to withstand
subfreezing environments and trained to pull sleds
across the tundra. War dogs are heavier, stronger dogs
trained to fight and kill on command; typically they are
accoutred in leather harnesses. Wild dogs will roam in
packs, ferocious scavengers and predators.
Special (all):
¬¬ Perspicacious to otherworldly horrors and the
undead; may bark or howl in their presence, even if
unseen (or disguised).
Special (blink dogs):
¬¬ When combating Chaotic Evil, they gain +4
damage bonuses due to enhanced ferocity (and
perhaps divine or otherworldly favour).
¬¬ In combat they blink in front of their enemies,
bite, and then blink away to a distance of 1d6×10
feet. Attacking a blink dog requires precise timing;
one first must make a successful test of dexterity (see
Vol. I, p. 7: Attributes, dexterity) to time a blow
possibly to hit a blink dog.
¬¬ When faced with unassailable odds, entire packs can
disappear to parts unknown.
