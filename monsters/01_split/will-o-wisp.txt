These haunting creatures manifest during nocturnal
hours, appearing as phosphorescent balls of light
(e.g., yellow, green, saffron, violet) in bogs, swamps,
marshes, or other places of desolation; too, they
might be encountered in dungeon labyrinths. Always
encountered solitarily, each will-o’-wisp comprises
from one to six balls of light that range from one to two
feet in diameter. A will-o’-wisp will flit about playfully,
feigning to be a playful færie and throbbing lovely
colour displays whilst emitting a peaceful hum. It will
lure a victim to a pit, quicksand, or another trap; then it
will attack, discharging powerful electricity that drains
the victim of life.
Special:
¬¬ Immune to sorcery, save protection from evil, which
will drive it away, and magic missile. Even a spell
such as sanctuary will not stop a will-o’-wisp.
¬¬ If reduced to 6 hp or fewer, the creature will turn
pale blue and lead its conqueror(s) to its lair, which
might contains its treasure.
