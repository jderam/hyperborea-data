These solid-hoofed, herbivorous mammals oft are
domesticated and trained. Typically they have long,
flowing tails and manes and (in Hyperborea) thick,
shaggy coats. Many breeds exist and are classified in
general terms.
A draught horse is the largest, bred for power and
endurance to pull a plough or waggon. Horses of
draught-quality breed run wild on the Hyperborean
plains; 1-in-10 might be suited to become a warhorse, if
raised from a foal.
Special:
¬¬ Horses (but not donkeys, mules, or ponies) can
treble their movement rates in short bursts.
