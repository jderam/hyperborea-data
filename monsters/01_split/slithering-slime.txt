This three-inch-thick, three-foot-diameter pool of
slime absorbs the fluids of other organisms through
protoplasmic fingers on its underside. The slithering
slime is a transparent dungeon dweller; often it comes
upon its quarry by surprize, paralyzing with its touch
and then draining its victim dry. Once it smells prey, it
will follow for several hours and wait to attack when the
target is asleep, sensitive to breathing patterns. It can
squeeze through small openings, under doors, and so
forth.
Special:
¬¬ Transparency increased chance to surprize by
2-in-6.
¬¬ Touch paralyzes for 2d6 turns unless death save is
made. Creature then drains fluids from paralyzed
victim at a rate of 1d6 hp per round; typically it is
sated after draining 1d20+20 hp.
