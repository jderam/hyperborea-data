These massive animals grow to 15 feet long and 8 feet at
the shoulder, weighing as much as 7,500 pounds. Their
enormous heads are adorned with pairs of massive
horns that project from the anterior of their skulls.
Woolly rhinoceroses are covered with plates, whence
grows dense, shaggy fur (usually white). They thrive
in the least hospitable of Hyperborean climates, using
their massive horns to dig out vegetation from under
the snow and ice. Woolly rhinos are temperamental and
aggressive; when they see men, they charge to kill, for
they are savvy to his spears and arrows.
Special:
¬¬ Initial attack is charging gore and trample, so long
as rhino has at least 50-foot running start. It can
trample from one to four enemies (assuming each
is within five feet of one another), whilst goring
one with its horn. Charging gore inflicts double
damage dice; trample damage is standard.
