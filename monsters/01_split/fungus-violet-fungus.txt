Violet fungi are similar in size and appearance to
shrieker fungi; in fact, the two species might be found
together in subterranean environments. This fungus
is a carrion eater, extending its three thorny branches
(of from three- to five-foot length, emerging from the
cap) to flail approaching victims. The touch of a violet
fungus rots flesh, upon which it then feeds.
Special:
¬¬ Touch rots flesh on contact unless death (poison)
save is made. If the save fails, the victim’s flesh rots
rapidly; unless cure disease is cast within 1 turn, a
painful death is imminent.
