A bipedal reptilian of ancient
origins, the cat-sized
pegomastax has a long
neck and tail, a hooked
beak beweaponed with
large upper and lower
tusks, a pair of grasping
forelimbs, and two
strong, claw-tipped
legs. Long, soft
bristles cover the
rear of its
mottled
brown
head and
back.
The pegomastax inhabits arid regions such as Diamond
Desert, where it feeds on tough leaves and other
vegetation. Like archæopteryges, some are trained as
familiars by magicians and witches.
Special:
¬¬ If both claw attacks hit one opponent, it uses its
rear claws to rend, each causing 1d2 hp additional
damage.
