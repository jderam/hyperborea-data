A tiger is a great striped cat that inhabits the
grasslands and woodlands of Hyperborea. Whitecoated
tigers with black or brown stripes are the norm
in the grasslands and tundra, whereas tigers of yellowbrown
coats and black stripes roam the woodlands.
Adult males typically measure eight feet long (plus tail)
and weigh as much as 650 pounds; adult females are
about three-quarters this size.
Special:
¬¬ All tigers are superior stalkers; chance to surprize
increased by 2-in-6.
¬¬ If both claw attacks hit, the cat automatically rakes
with its two rear claws for 2d4 hp damage each.
