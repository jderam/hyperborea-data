This disturbing creature has the lower body of a large
eagle and the naked torso and head of an unsightly
woman with terrible fangs. The harpy’s enchanting
song lures men and other creatures to it, only to be
slain and devoured. Harpies build nests in trees and
cliff sides. They speak proto-Hellenic and the Common
tongue.
Special:
¬¬ +2 bonus to sorcery saves.
¬¬ Song charms all within 60 feet who hear it,
unless sorcery saves are made; the saves are
modified by willpower
adjustment (see Vol. I,
p. 9: Attributes,
wisdom), if
applicable.
Charmed
individuals will
stand dumbly,
allowing the
harpies to do
as they will,
even kill
them.
