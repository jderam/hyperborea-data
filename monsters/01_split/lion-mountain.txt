A mountain lion is a sleek feline long of body and
limbs. This great cat thrives in many regions, not just
mountains; in non-mountain habitats they might be
referred to as cougars or pumas. Adults are six feet long
and weigh 250 pounds. They are protective of their
domain; otherwise they are unlikely to attack men.
Typically a solitary hunter, a mountain lion will hide
under brush and foliage to stalk prey. They are adept
climbers and can leap up to 18 feet.
Special:
¬¬ If a mountain lion hits with both claw
attacks, rear claws automatically rake for 1d4+1
hp damage each.
