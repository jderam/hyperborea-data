Several snake species inhabit Hyperborea. The asp,
python, rattlesnake, spitting cobra, and viper are
some of the more eminent varieties. They hibernate
during the winter years, except perhaps on the warmer
outer islands, such as New Amazonia.
The spitting cobra is a five- to six-foot-long, pale grey
snake capable of firing a stream of venom. A spitting
cobra usually attacks only when startled or threatened,
rearing up and releasing a jet of virulent spittle.
Spitting cobras also can bite, their venom potentially
deadly. They cannot shoot venom and bite in the same
round.
Special:
¬¬ Once per day can spit venom to range of 15, aiming
for target’s eyes. If venom hits, victim must
make death (poison) save or be blinded. Only cure
blindness restores sight. Great helm (typically
included with field plate and full plate) blocks
venom on 3-in-6 chance.
¬¬ Bite injects venom twice per day. Victim must make
death (poison) save or die in 1d6+6 turns.
