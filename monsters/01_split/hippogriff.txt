Born of the union betwixt a male griffin and a filly, this
legendary beast has the head, wings, and forequarters
of a giant eagle and the hindquarters of a powerful
horse. Temperamental carnivorous beasts, hippogriffs
rarely are tamed. They nest in the rocky crags of
mountainous regions and fiercely defend their eyries.
