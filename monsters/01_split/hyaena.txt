Carnivorous, doglike animal noted for its coarse, spotted
fur and powerful jaws, but most famous for its
weird and haunting howl, which resembles the hysterical
laughter of a human, albeit a mad one. Two species
are extant in mainland Hyperborea: the common hyæna
and the giant hyæna.
Hyænas are notorious scavengers, able to
sniff out carrion from several miles away. Typically,
they will not attack humans unless desperate or if they
significantly outnumber their prey.
