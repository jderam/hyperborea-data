Frost giants are the true sons of Ymir, with ice-blue skin
and red or yellow hair. They stand some 16 or more feet
in height and weigh as much as 2,000 pounds. They are
known to train winter wolves or polar bears to hunt or
to guard their dwellings: labyrinthine ice caverns or vast,
mountaintop castles.
Frost giants are cruel, hateful humanoids. In Hyperborea
they are the natural enemies of Vikings, who believe
Ymir spawns frost giants in his image to challenge their
strength and loyalty. Frost giants work enormous forges,
able to craft massive weapons of iron and steel; also they
enslave dwarfs to forge for them. They are particularly
fond of axes and hammers. Larger clans will have a
prominent jarl, a 20-foot-tall, 3,000-pound frost giant of
enormous girth and greater wickedness; for every 12 frost
giants there is 1 jarl. Frost giants speak Old Norse and the
Common tongue.
