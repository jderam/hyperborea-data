The albino ape is a massive white simian dwelling in
caves and caverns. Adult males grow up to seven feet
high and weigh as much as 600 pounds; females are
slightly smaller. Nocturnal and carnivorous, these
gorilla-like beasts demonstrate limited intelligence
through primitive tool use.
Typically they live in groups of 7–10, with one alpha
male, two or three females, and the remainder young;
otherwise, adult males will live solitarily, though a
sibling pair is possible. If approached, the apes will
pound their chests and roar. A man who carefully backs
away might escape (3-in-6 chance); otherwise the apes
will react violently. Albino apes are known to emerge
in the black of night to chase Ythaqqa, “The Wendigo”,
across the Plain of Leng, howling and frothing in
bestial rapture.
Special:
¬¬ Acute sense of smell; chance to be surprized
reduced by 1-in-6.
