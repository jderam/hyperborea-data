These parasitic arachnids lurk in forests, caves, and
caverns. They are oval in shape, measure up to three
feet in diameter, and possess strong exoskeletons. They
lurk in branches, under foliage, or on cavern ceilings,
waiting to lurch or drop upon their warm-blooded
victims. Their bite is venomous.
Special:
¬¬ Chance to surprize increased by 1-in-6 when
dropping from a tree or another suitable hiding
place.
¬¬ Bite transmits venom; make death (poison) save at
+2 bonus or suffer paralysis for 1d2 turns.
¬¬ Tick remains attached once bite is established,
draining blood for 1d6 hp damage per round until
either victim or tick is dead.
¬¬ Can be driven off with fire; 3-in-6 chance it releases
if already attached.
