Giant lizard species can be encountered in the more
temperate surface areas of Hyperborea during the
spring and summer years, but by Twilight they will
hibernate. Exceptions include specimens that populate
some of the warmer outer islands, such as New
Amazonia, and those that inhabit warm subterranean
lairs.
A giant draco lizard is a rusty-orange lizard of sevenfoot
length (plus tail). Folds of skin stretch from its
ribs in a fanlike shape, enabling it to glide hundreds of
yards. Giant draco lizards attack in groups, sweeping
down to bite their prey. N.B.: Lizard-men are known to
ride these flying reptiles.
Special:
¬¬ Initial attack is a swooping bite at a +2 attack
bonus.
