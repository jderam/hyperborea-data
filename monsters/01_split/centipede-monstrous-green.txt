The monstrous green centipede is a myriapod from 30
to 40 feet long that dwells in the deepest subterranean
caverns of Hyperborea. Its large mandibles inflict
crushing damage, but its venom is less toxic than its
smaller counterparts. This centipede is a surprisingly
fast creature that aims to entrap its prey in an
underbelly cavity; it then retreats to digest its victims’
flesh and blood, ejecting any other remains in a
spherical pile.
Special:
¬¬ Bite delivers venom; make
death (poison) save or suffer
slow effect (as the spell) for
2d6 turns.
¬¬ Can entrap slowed victims:
The centipede rears up, its
underbelly exoskeletal plates
swing open, and its legs
scoop the victim into one of its two or three coffinsized
cavities. This manoeuvre requires a separate
attack roll (non-damaging), and an avoidance
save is permitted. Inside the centipede, an acidic,
digestive gel releases, causing 1 hp damage per
turn until death or escape. The entrapped may
attempt to push open the exoskeletal plates via
an extraordinary feat of strength (see Vol. I, p. 7:
Attributes, strength). Alternatively, he can use
a WC 1–3 blade to cut his way free, with an attack
penalty equal to the weapon class; the entrapped
must inflict 20 hp damage to break free.
