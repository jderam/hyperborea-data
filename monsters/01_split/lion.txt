A lion is a large, powerful, carnivorous cat able to
thrive in most environments. An adult male typically
measures nearly nine feet long and four feet at the
shoulder, weighing as much as 500 pounds; an adult
female is about one-half to three-quarters this size.
A lion is capable of releasing a powerful roar. They
generally avoid men, but some develop a taste for
human flesh. Usually they hunt in small groups; prides
are larger. N.B.: A pride might comprise 25% cubs.
Special:
¬¬ If a lion hits with both claw attacks, rear claws
automatically rake for 1d6+1 hp damage each.
