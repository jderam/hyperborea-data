This enormous, segmented worm grows to 100 feet in
length and 10 feet in diameter, its great, round maw
lined with three rows of fangs. Each body segment is
ring-like and projects two pairs of bristles that are about
three feet long. These chætæ give the monster locomotion
as it burrows through the earth, creating “tubes” by
means of a sticky, purple secretion that coats its body.
Purple worms are omnivorous, though they prefer
flesh. They will emerge from their subterranean tunnels
to feed on surface dwellers, which are betrayed by the
subtle vibrations of their movement. Purple worms are
typically solitary, though they will migrate hundreds of
miles to congregate and mate. It is a matter of conjecture
as to whether purple worms have any connexion with
Yikkorth, “The Ashen Worm”.
Special:
¬¬ If bite attack hits by a margin of 4 or more (or on a
natural 20 in any case), victim is swallowed whole,
inflicting 1d6 hp damage per round thereafter; after
3 rounds, the victim may asphyxiate (see Vol. III,
p. 263: Special Damage, asphyxia). Swallowed
prey can cut its way out with a WC 1–3 blade, with
an attack penalty equal to the weapon class. If 10
hp damage is inflicted from within, a large enough
rent is cut for escape.
¬¬ Tail sting used when confronted from rear, or if
space allows the beast to curl its posterior. Sting
delivers venom that is immediately deadly unless a
death (poison) save is made.
