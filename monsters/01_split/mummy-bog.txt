Bog mummies are foul corpses that have been
preserved by the foetid, acidic water of a peat bog. As
sacrificial victims of unspeakable cruelty, they also
suffer the dreaded curse of undeath, restless beings that
despise humanity. They lurk in moss-hag pools such as
those found in the Lug Wasteland. Their desiccated skin
is brown and tough, their internal bones decomposed
to a glutinous gunge; thus they ambulate like walking
sacks of jelly-stuffed leather, bloated with congealed
acids that they can disgorge to deadly effect.
Special:
¬¬ Immune to poison, paralysis, fear, and cold.
¬¬ Mundane chopping or slashing weapons (e.g.,
axes, scimitars, swords) cause ½ damage to bog
mummies; mundane blunt or piercing weapons
(e.g., hammers, maces, arrows, spears) cause ¼
damage. Magical weapons of all kinds cause full
damage.
¬¬ Thrice per day can vomit a 10-foot-long cone of
gelatinous acid that is 5 feet wide at the terminus
and causes 2d4 hp damage, with avoidance saves
allowed for ½ damage. If saving throws fail, the
acid sticks, causing an additional 1d4 hp damage on
the 2nd round unless immediately scraped off (such
as with the back of a blade).
¬¬ If it has not ejected its acid thrice and is cut down
with physical force, bog mummy explodes on a
1-in-6 chance, with effects as shewn above to all
creatures within 10 feet.
