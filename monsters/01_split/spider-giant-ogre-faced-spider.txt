The giant ogre-faced spider is an eight-foot-long
arachnid renowned for its face, which is reminiscent
of a mountain ape—specifically its disturbingly large
eyes, one twice the size of the other. From trees, crags,
or abandoned buildings, it hangs by a strand of dry
silk, holding its web net with its four front legs. As prey
passes below, it stretches open the net, casting it over
and enveloping the prey.
Special:
¬¬ If entrapped in a web, a man can break free in
19 rounds − strength score; e.g., 3 rounds with 16 ST.
¬¬ Chance to surprize increased by 1-in-6 when
attacking from above.
¬¬ Throws web net over a single Small or Medium
victim. If victim is surprized, success is automatic;
if not surprized, avoidance save is allowed to evade.
¬¬ Bite victim experiences extreme swelling and skin
ulcerations, coupled with intense joint pain that
limits physical activity (½ MV; −2 penalty to attack
rolls, damage, and saving throws). Death ensues
in 6d6 turns unless death (poison) save is made;
swelling subsides in 1d4+6 hours.
