Bird-men have small, featherless heads, stout yellow
beaks, and inquisitive black eyes. They stand upright
and average seven feet tall, two feet of which comprise
their long, featherless necks; however, because their
necks droop, their full height scarcely is realized. Birdmen
have long, scaly legs that end in three-toed talons,
narrow upper bodies feathered in black, and powerful
wings that span eight or more feet. Their wings are
plumed in black, white, and brown (females) or red
(males).
This race of semi-intelligent,
humanoid birds rarely lives in
autonomy; primarily bird-men exist
in servility to other intelligent beings.
This arrangement suits them so long
as they are sheltered and fed (grains
and small lizards, fish, or amphibians).
Typically a small flock (including
mated pairs) will serve a master.
Solitary bird-men oft refuse to eat and
will die of starvation, unable to carry
on without the companionship of the
flock.
Bird-men are notorious for both
their cowardice and their incessant
garrulity, for they speak the Common
tongue of men. They can be obstinate
(oft refusing to complete tasks),
lazy, argumentative, and insulting
(especially to one another), but when
motivated they can be trained to fly
collectively a basket of cargo that
weighs no more than 200 pounds
per bird-man. They almost always
flee violence; however the threat of
violence from their masters rarely
inspires them to cooperation. Almost
nothing can convince them to fly over a
large body of water. In short, bird-men
are a quirky, intractable species.
Special:
¬¬ Rumours speak of shamanic birdmen
in the untamed wilds of the
Spiral Mountain Array. These can
advance as high as 7th level; for
each level beyond 1st, they add 1 hit
die (d8) to their base 1 HD.
