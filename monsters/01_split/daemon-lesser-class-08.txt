This nine-foot-tall, hunchbacked, bowlegged mockery
of a man has a warty, red-violet hide and horrible
bloodshot eyes. It carries out any enterprise of
destruction with zeal, emitting booming laughter all
the while. Even stone eventually will yield to its horny
fists. Evil witches are wont to summon these violent
dæmons for carnal relations. What progeny may be
born from these unnatural unions is a subject far too
revolting to contemplate.
Special:
¬¬ 3-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For
every CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty
increases by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p. 261: Saving
Throw, spell resistance).
¬¬ Cold, electricity, fire, and gas attacks inflict
½ damage, or ¼ damage if save is made.
¬¬ Fists can inflict 1d4 hull points per round to a ship,
or smash a wooden door to flinders with a single
blow. Any stone or metal object struck must make
a class 2 item saving throw or be destroyed. Effects
on larger stone or metal constructions (e.g., walls)
are left to the
referee’s
judgment, but
they eventually
should be
breached or
battered
down.
