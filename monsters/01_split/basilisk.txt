A magical beast of legendry, this large, eight-legged
reptile typically dwells in caverns or thick, tangled
forests. Those who meet its gaze or touch its hide
are turned to stone.
The basilisk is about
10 feet long (not
including tail),
with dun-coloured
scales and a yellow
underbelly. Its jaws
are lined with sharp
teeth, and its eyes are
large, blue-green, and
somewhat lamp-like.
With their eight short
and powerful legs,
basilisks can scale
vertical surfaces to the
caves within which
they build their nests;
oft these caves appear
to be statuaries of
the men and beasts
that daringly (or
unwittingly) entered
the monsters’ lairs.
Special:
¬¬ Meeting its gaze or touching its
hide causes one to turn to stone unless
a transformation save is made. Surprized
combatants almost always (5-in-6 chance) look in
the basilisk’s eyes. Combatants in melee combat
with the creature can look away, but doing so
causes their attack rolls and armour class to be at
−2 penalties.
¬¬ The basilisk can be turned to stone if it sees its
reflexion in a mirror; of course, effectively using
a mirror requires sufficient lighting. The base
chance of success is 2-in-6, subject to the referee’s
discretion. The basilisk must make a transformation
save to avoid the effect.
