Bandits are outlaws, robbers, or pirates who have
joined together to kill and rob the innocent. Vaguely
their statistics conform to fighters, though perhaps
with some thievish skills, too; pirates, for example,
speak a form of Thieves’ Cant exclusive to seafarers (see
Vol. I, p, 21: Classes, thief). Some bandits might have a
cleric or magician in their employ. For every 10 bandits
there will be 1 lieutenant, and for every 25 bandits there
will be 1 captain.
Special:
¬¬ Lieutenants might have weapon mastery with one
weapon, captains possibly two (+1 to attack and
damage rolls, increased attack rate, etc.; see Vol. I,
p. 112: Weapon Skill, weapon mastery).
