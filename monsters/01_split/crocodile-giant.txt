Giant crocodiles of 50-foot length lurk in the sea,
though sometimes in coastal marshlands. They are
notorious for tearing open the hulls of ships.
Special:
¬¬ On a natural 19 or 20 attack roll, the giant crocodile
swallows its victim whole, inflicting 1d6 hp damage
per round thereafter; after 3 rounds, the victim may
asphyxiate (see Vol. III, p. 263: Special Damage,
asphyxia). Swallowed prey can cut its way out with
a WC 1–3 blade, with an attack penalty equal to
the weapon class. If 12 hp damage is inflicted from
within, a large enough rent is cut for escape.
