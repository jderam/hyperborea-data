Mightiest of the lesser dæmons, this entity is a
humanoid some eight feet in height with profuse
strange blades and spikes. Its midnight-blue form
appears more mechanical than organic, and its eyes
burn with orange fire (as do any rents made in its body
by weapons). It can speak any human tongue, but rarely
deigns to do so. These dæmons sometimes are called
forth from the netherworld by sorcerers and bidden to
provide transport to other parts of Hyperborea, or even
to open the way to shadowy realms beyond. The chance
of being stranded is very real when dealing with these
enigmatic beings.
Special:
¬¬ 6-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For
every CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty
increases by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p. 261: Saving
Throw, spell resistance).
¬¬ Cold, electricity, fire, and gas attacks inflict
½ damage, or ¼ damage if save is made.
¬¬ Harmed only by silver or magical weapons.
¬¬ Can cast the following spells
at will (though
only one at a time):
dimension door,
silence, tongues.
¬¬ Once per day
each, can cast
plane shift
and teleport
(without
error). Unlike
mortal
sorcerers, the
dæmon can
teleport itself
with a willing
passenger.
