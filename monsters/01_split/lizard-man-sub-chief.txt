A lizard-man is a water-dwelling, reptilian biped, with an
iguana-like head, a pronounced spine ridge, and a long
tail. Its scaly skin ranges from brown to green. Lizardmen
are herbivorous, egg-bearing creatures that typically
thrive along the seacoast, in swamps or marshes, or by
rivers and lakes.
Lizard-men are possessed of primitive intelligence,
utilizing spears and clubs of their own manufacture, or
the weapons of men when they can acquire them.
Some lizard-man tribes have developed crude
archery techniques. They speak their own sibilant
tongue, but some can speak a rudimentary form
of the Common tongue of
man; others still understand
an antiquated Thracian
dialect. Advanced tribes
have developed a method
for riding giant draco
lizards, affixing these
massive creatures with
riding harnesses.
Lizard-men are reclusive by nature; when intruded
upon, they oft capture and execute the trespassers as
part of some clandestine ritual. During winter years,
lizard-men of mainland Hyperborea will burrow into
underground caverns, where they will hibernate for
months if not years at a time. For every 12 lizard-men
there will be 1 sub-chief, a commander of superior
fighting skills; for every 50 lizard-men there will be
1 chieftain, a reptilian shaman who venerates ancestral
spirits.
