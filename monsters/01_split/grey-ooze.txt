This amorphous horror resembles wet stone and can
be quite difficult to discern in its native environment
of subterranean caverns and dungeons. Grey oozes can
squeeze through the smallest cracks. The creatures secrete
corrosive acid that dissolves all material save stone.
When it attacks, a grey ooze will rise up, its form vaguely
manlike, and it will lash out with a rapidly formed
appendage.
Special:
¬¬ Chance to surprize increased by 1-in-6 when
emerging from stone surroundings.
¬¬ Immune to cold and fire.
¬¬ Weapons and lightning will harm it as normal, but
weapons are ruined unless magical; however, if
magical weapons are not wiped clean within 1 turn,
they too will be ruined.
¬¬ Once it hits, grey ooze sticks to its victim, delivering
additional 2d8 hp damage per round; destroys
mundane armour in 1 round, but magical armour
lasts 1 turn before corroding (unless wiped clean).
