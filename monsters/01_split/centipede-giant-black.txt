Giant centipedes are multi-segmented arthropods,
up to 2½ feet long and narrow, with a pair of legs
projecting from each segment. They typically inhabit
mild, moist environments, as well as caverns and
dungeons deep. Many varieties of giant centipede exist
(some of which are edible). Notorious species include
the giant black centipede, a glossy black variety noted
for its bands of orange and yellow; the giant brown
centipede, noted for its light red underbelly; and the
giant pink centipede, noted for its green spots. The
black and pink centipedes’ pincer bites inflict minimal
damage, but their venom is potentially deadly; the
brown centipede’s pincer bite delivers acidic, skineating
venom.
Special:
¬¬ Bite delivers venom; make death (poison) save or
suffer an additional 2d6 hp damage—a painful,
blood-boiling sensation.
