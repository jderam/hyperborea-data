Ice toads are tiny creatures, white as snow, with
bright blue warts and vivid cerulean eyes. They are
said to thrive in the coldest environments, their blood
unfreezing.
Special:
¬¬ Immune to the effects of normal cold to −15°F; they
must burrow to survive colder temperatures.
¬¬ Camouflage provides 6-in-12 chance to hide in snow
(see Vol. I, p. 21: Classes, thief).
¬¬ If ice toad is bitten or licked, a death (poison) save
must be made or the victim suffers 1d4 hp damage.
Ice toad toxin does not cause continuing damage.
A toad produces enough toxin to coat a dagger
when provoked; enterprising sorcerers are known
to use their toad familiars to envenom their blades
or fill a phial with a single dose once per day. The
toxin evaporates after 6 turns or a single successful
strike; if bottled, it remains efficacious for 24 hours.
