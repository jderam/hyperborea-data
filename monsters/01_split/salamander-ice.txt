The ice salamander is a terrestrial species of water
elemental, serpentine in form (though six-legged),
with the head and limbs of a lizard. The beast is as long
as 18 feet and has bright blue scales banded yellow
and white. Ice salamanders typically dwell in glaciated
regions, carving their lairs out from ice. When they fight
they rear up on their hind legs to attack with four claws
and one bite. Ice salamanders are semi-intelligent, and
they attack fire salamanders on sight.
Special:
