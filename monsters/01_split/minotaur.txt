This is the seven-foot-tall beast of legendry. It has the
body of a powerfully muscled man, with the massive
shoulders and horned head of a bull. Minotaurs are
nigh fearless combatants and prefer to fight with
spears, war clubs, battle axes, or great axes, though they
will employ almost any melee weapon.
Minotaurs have a taste for human flesh and typically
will kill and eat men raw, unless it profits them to do
otherwise, for they are intelligent and greedy. In the
wilderness, minotaur tribes base much of their culture
on the chase and hunt, finding particular delight in the
resourcefulness of hunted men. Most minotaurs speak
the Common tongue of man; others speak a form of
proto-Hellenic.
On the islands of Minotaurios, settlements of as many
as 50 minotaurs may be encountered. Minotaurs dwell
in any environment, but most prefer labyrinthine
dungeon dwellings. In the deepest dungeon depths
dwells the minotaur superior, a robust, eight-foot,
900-pound brute of tremendous power and ferocity,
with doubled horns.
Special:
¬¬ Unaffected by forget the path (reverse of find the
path), maze, and like sorcery.
