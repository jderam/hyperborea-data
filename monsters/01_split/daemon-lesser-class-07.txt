This dæmon appears as a mandibulate dragon
some five feet in height, with electric blue hide and
chartreuse crest. Its body radiates heat that can be felt
some distance away, and it can expel a cloud of whitehot
ashes. Class vii lesser dæmons are particularly
notorious as slayers of Lawful clerics and despoilers
of Lawful temples, either of which they are wont to set
ablaze.
Special:
¬¬ Emits intense heat; any creature within 10 feet
suffers 1d6 hp damage per round.
¬¬ 3-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For
every CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty
increases by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p. 261: Saving
Throw, spell resistance).
¬¬ Cold, electricity, fire, and gas attacks inflict
½ damage, or ¼ damage if save is made.
¬¬ +2 attack bonus versus Lawful clerics or priests.
¬¬ Can expel scorching ashes thrice per day in a
10-foot-long cone, 5 feet wide at the terminus,
causing damage equal to the dæmon’s current hit
points (avoidance save for ½ damage).
