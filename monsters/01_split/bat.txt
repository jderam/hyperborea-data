A bat is the typical brown, black, red, or silver-haired
variety that might be encountered in forests, caves,
caverns, dungeons, and ruins. Bats are of course
nocturnal creatures; during extended periods of
complete daylight, many species will hibernate.
Special:
¬¬ 1-in-4 bats will carry a disease. A bite victim
must make a death (poison) save or suffer pain
and burning at the site of the infection, followed
by headaches, muscle spasms, and difficulty
swallowing. Death ensues in 2d6 days unless cure
disease is cast.
