These solid-hoofed, herbivorous mammals oft are
domesticated and trained. Typically they have long,
flowing tails and manes and (in Hyperborea) thick,
shaggy coats. Many breeds exist and are classified in
general terms.
A riding horse is smaller and lighter-boned than a
draught horse, but capable of bearing a rider for great
distances. Wild horses of riding horse quality run free
on the Hyperborean plains. Wild foals may be tamed,
though the older the horse, the less likely this prospect
becomes.
Special:
¬¬ Horses (but not donkeys, mules, or ponies) can
treble their movement rates in short bursts.
