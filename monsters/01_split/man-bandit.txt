Bandits are outlaws, robbers, or pirates who have
joined together to kill and rob the innocent. Vaguely
their statistics conform to fighters, though perhaps
with some thievish skills, too; pirates, for example,
speak a form of Thieves’ Cant exclusive to seafarers (see
Vol. I, p, 21: Classes, thief). Some bandits might have a
cleric or magician in their employ. For every 10 bandits
there will be 1 lieutenant, and for every 25 bandits there
will be 1 captain.
