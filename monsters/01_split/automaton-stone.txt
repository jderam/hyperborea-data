Automata are humanoid constructs of mad sorcerers
and their ilk, the formulæ for the creation of
which trace back to a bygone age when Atlanteans,
Hyperboreans, and Lemurians commingled sorcery
and science. Strange wires, conduits, batteries, cells,
and circuits are installed in many of these creations,
though no two manuals of automaton creation (see
Vol. V, p. 482: Magical Treasure, miscellaneous
magic items) describe precisely identical processes;
alternative methods of creation were engendered by the
ancients, but this is a lost science in rapidly decaying
Hyperborea.
A stone automaton is a 10-foot-tall statue chiselled
from granite or marble, oft with the likeness of a
sword or an axe in hand. Stone automata are the least
intelligent type, able to comprehend seven simple
commands, which must be programmed during the
creation process. Typical commands include “Attack!”,
“Capture!”, “Follow!”, “Stop!”, and “Wait!” Ambiguous
commands such as “Guard!” may be misunderstood;
the monster might guard a place instead of a person,
even if a person was the intent.
Special:
¬¬ +1 or better weapon to hit.
¬¬ Immune to sorcery, except stone to flesh (renders
creature AC 8 and vulnerable to normal weapons
for 1d4 rounds) and transmute rock to mud (functions
as slow spell for 2d6 rounds).
