These slimy, 8- to 10-foot-tall, vaguely humanoid
monsters appear to be composed of sopping wet,
rotting vegetable matter bound by pale roots and
thick, gnarly tendrils. Shambling mounds dwell in
swamps, marshes, subterranean caverns, or other
places where moisture is abundant. They are omnivores
with insatiable appetites for organic matter (plant
or animal), and they fearlessly attack with their ropy
arms, latching on to prey. Shambling mounds are
possessed of primitive intelligence; their brains are
phosphorescent masses of green fibres located in
their midsections, which upon removal can be used as
light sources (10-foot radius) for 1d6 hours following
extraction.
Special:
¬¬ Immune to fire; cold attacks cause ½
damage.
¬¬ Electrical attacks provide a 1d8 hp
boost.
¬¬ Vulnerable to plant-related spells
(saves at −2 penalty).
¬¬ Weapon attacks inflict ½
damage.
¬¬ If both attacks strike the same
target, victim is entangled by
roots that will suffocate him
(see Vol. III, p. 263: Special
Damage, asphyxia).
The shambling mound
will attempt simply to
walk away with such
a victim in its grasp,
refusing to release unless
killed. An extraordinary
feat of strength (see Vol. I,
p. 7: Attributes, strength)
allows one to break free.
