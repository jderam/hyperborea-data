Snakes of great size inhabit the dark corners of
Hyperborea; whether their prodigious length is a
natural development or the result of sorcery is a matter
of conjecture. Except on some islands at the Rim of the
World, these reptiles are less active during the winter
years.
The giant spitting cobra is a solitary creature up to
30 feet long and nearly exclusive to dungeon depths.
The scales of these monstrous reptiles are hard as iron.
They are reputed to possess quasi-intelligence; some
sages posit they are former Ixian priests of Yig (Apep)
transmogrified.
Special:
¬¬ Once per day can spit venom to range of 30,
aiming for target’s eyes. If venom hits, victim
must make death (poison) save or be blinded.
Only cure blindness restores sight. Great helm
(typically included with field plate and full plate)
blocks venom on 3-in-6 chance.
¬¬ Bite injects venom thrice per day. Victim must
make death (poison) save or die in 1d6+6 rounds.
