This deadly subterranean fungus of dark yellow
colour grows in furry patches of about eight square
feet, though larger colonies are not unusual. Mustard
mould propagates in dark, moist places and is known
to favour tapestries and other heavy cloths, though is
just as likely to be found on wood. Through these media
the mustard mould eats, but not metal or stone. The
mustard mould does not “attack”, per se, but reacts to
being handled by releasing a deadly cloud of spores.
Special:
¬¬ Harmed only by fire, a torch inflicting 1d6 hp
damage per round.
¬¬ When handled, struck, or burnt, 3-in-6 chance
it releases a 10 × 10 × 10-foot cloud of spores. The
cloud burns the eyes, nose, and throat; those
within must make death (poison) saves or choke to
death in 6 rounds.
