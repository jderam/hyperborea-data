This eight- to nine-foot-tall dæmon has a humanoid
body, with the neck and head of a vulture and charcoalgrey
wings that span 12 feet. Too, the dæmon’s torso
is a ruddy grey, girt in black feathers. Class I greater
dæmons have large, clawed hands and enormous,
taloned feet. Not the most intelligent of dæmonkind,
they have a fondness for human flesh, and they are
quite greedy, hoarding gold and gems. They only dwell
in the world of men because someone (or something)
has beckoned them forth.
Special:
¬¬ 7-in-20 spell resistance versus
CA 12 casters. For every
CA level less than 12, the
chance-in-twenty increases
by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p.
261: Saving Throw, spell
resistance).
¬¬ Cold, electricity, fire, and gas
attacks inflict ½ damage, or
¼ damage if save is made.
¬¬ Can cast the following spells
at will (though only one
at a time): darkness, detect
invisibility, infrared vision,
telekinesis, teleport (without
error).
¬¬ Once per day, can attempt
to beckon another class I
greater dæmon to fight
alongside it (as reverse of
dismissal), with 1-in-6 chance
of success. Alternatively, it
can attempt to summon 1d6
class i lesser dæmons or
1d4 class ii lesser dæmons,
with 4-in-6 chance of
success.
