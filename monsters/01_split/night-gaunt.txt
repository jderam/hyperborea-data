These uncouth monsters, sometimes called “Dwellers
in the Boreas”, are vaguely humanoid of shape, seven
or more feet tall, and incredibly thin and rubbery. Their
skin is jet black and glistens like oil, and from their
foreheads project two inwards-curving horns. They have
membranous wings projecting from their shoulder
blades and barbed, prehensile tails of seven-foot
length. Each of their fingers terminates in a black talon.
Perhaps the most disturbing quality of this horror is its
countenance, for where a face should be there is naught.
These otherworldly creatures dwell in the illimitable
Black Gulf, just beyond the rim of Hyperborea’s spilling
seas. By legion they ride the boreas (North Wind), and
from there they have the capacity to haunt the dreams
of the most precocious
children. On occasion,
however, they escape,
bringing terror
and misfortune
and engaging
in unspeakable
acts.
