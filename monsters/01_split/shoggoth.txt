Shoggoths present as gargantuan, amorphous
creatures of foetid black iridescence. These shapeless
beings bubble with disgusting pustules of greenish
light from which a multitude of temporary “eyes”
glisten. They move with great plasticity, rolling, oozing,
and slithering their enormous bulk (as large as 25 × 25
× 25 feet of protoplasmic matter) as fluidly as a python.
They thrive on land as well as in the deepest ocean
depths.
In epochs past these unhallowed beasts were created
by the elder things, genetically engineered to serve as
a slave race that could perform multitudinous tasks.
For untold ages their wicked, otherworldly masters
believed the shoggoths were bereft of individuality,
even after they had been evolved to perform the
most intricate and complex of enterprises. Alas, the
shoggoths rebelled against their masters, and wars
raged betwixt them for untold ages, over land, sea, and
even the cold blackness of space. At length both races
were nearly extinct, and surviving specimens regressed
to utter savagery.
Special:
¬¬ Immune to cold.
¬¬ When shoggoth is struck by weapons or lightning,
a smaller one is created (e.g., a 4-HD shoggoth
that deals 2d6 hp damage), whilst the main body
quickly regenerates, its capacities not reduced.
¬¬ Harmed only by fire; other spells may adversely
affect it, but those that are not fire-related and that
normally inflict physical harm merely will split the
creature in twain as noted above.
¬¬ Corrodes leather on contact and metal in 2d4
rounds (including weapons and armour, though
magical metal survives 1 extra round per “plus”).
¬¬ Enzyme release allows it to heat and transform
stone or earth into a tarry, quicksand-like
substance within which it can hide or retreat.
