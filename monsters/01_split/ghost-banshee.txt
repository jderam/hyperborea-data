Two different types of banshee are known; both
are hazy, ghostly manifestations of a female spirit.
The first is the benevolent sort (typically a Keltic
ancestor spirit) that will warn of an impending death
in the family; this warning is made obvious by the
banshee’s long and frightful wail, or keening. The
second is the one represented in the above statistics:
a malevolent phantom of different purpose. These
frightful apparitions loathe the living. Typically they
lurk in places of ruin, or locales where misfortune has
transpired. Malevolent banshees use their keening
power to slay the living.
Special:
¬¬ Sight causes fear, unless sorcery saves are made.
The saves are modified by willpower adjustment (see
Vol. I, p. 9: Attributes, wisdom), if applicable.
If failed, victims flee for 2d6 rounds; if fleeing not
possible, victims cower and weep.
¬¬ Immune to poison, paralysis, fear, cold, and
electricity.
¬¬ The spell perform exorcism destroys a banshee.
¬¬ Harmed only by silver or magical weapons.
¬¬ Touch attack (the above-noted 1d10 hp damage) is
considered cold damage.
¬¬ Once per day, and only in darkness, can emit a wail
that slays living creatures within 30-foot radius,
unless death saves are made; victims die of heartstopping
fear, so willpower adjustment applies (see
Vol. I, p. 9: Attributes, wisdom).
