In the depths of the subterranean underworld lurk
these enormous, slimy molluscs. They can be 30 feet
long and 10 feet in diameter, though they can squeeze
through openings one-third their size. They are of pale
grey colour, with white or yellow underbellies and eye
stalks that extend up to five feet.
Giant slugs can burrow through hard-packed earth and
chew through wood with their acidic saliva. They are
voracious eaters of animal and vegetal material, and
they leave slimy, noxious trails in their wake. Giant
slugs will pursue prey for several hours if necessary to
sate their hunger.
Special:
¬¬ Corrosive acid spit once per round, as missile
attack to range of 60. If acid hits, victim must
make death (poison) save or die at once; even if
save succeeds, victim suffers 3d10 hp damage,
which includes massive scarring, a 2-in-6 chance of
blindness, and consequent armour and equipage
ruination (see Vol. III, p. 260: Saving Throw,
item saving throws).
¬¬ Immune to blunt weapon attacks (e.g., clubs,
hammers, maces) unless magical; edged and
pointed weapons are effective.
