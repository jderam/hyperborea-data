This grotesque entity appears as a gigantic starfish
topped by a humanoid body with four bony tentacles,
the whole being a nauseous green colour. It can move
with surprizing speed across any surface, even walls and
ceilings. The proboscis of this dæmon can spew a sticky
mass akin to a sorcerous web. It is said that these dæmons
prefer to make their worldly lairs beneath desecrated
Lawful temples, where the webbed bodies of their victims
are suspended in perpetual darkness and cold.
Special:
¬¬ Emits freezing cold; any creature within 10 feet
suffers 1d6 hp damage per round.
¬¬ 3-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For every
CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty increases
by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p. 261: Saving Throw, spell
resistance).
¬¬ Cold, electricity, fire, and gas
attacks inflict ½ damage, or
¼ damage if save is made.
¬¬ Thrice per day, can
discharge to a range of
15 feet a sticky mass
that functions
exactly as a web
spell.
