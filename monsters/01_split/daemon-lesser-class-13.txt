This dæmon manifests as a monstrous pink-and-yellow
invertebrate with two ridged tentacles, the whole
topped by a snarling wolf ’s head. The burning eyes of
this horror can emit deadly beams of pale fire. These
fiends prefer to dwell in subaqueous depths. It is said
they gather the wealth of sunken ships into troves of
great value, oft conscripting the dead crews of such
ships to guard the treasures.
