Appearing as a deformed dragon with insectan legs,
this dæmon is of dead-grey colour and sickening
miasmal odour. In addition to biting with the deadly
fangs in its malformed jaws, it can spew forth a stream
of revolting septic fluid. True to their stomach-turning
appearance and scent, these dæmons prefer to make
their lairs in swamps and sewers, where the bloated
corpses of previous
victims oft
are found
floating.
Special:
¬¬ Any living creature with 10 feet must make death
(poison) save or suffer nausea, causing −2 attack
penalty for 1 turn.
¬¬ 5-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For
every CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty
increases by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p. 261: Saving
Throw, spell resistance).
¬¬ Cold, electricity, fire, and gas attacks inflict
½ damage, or ¼ damage if save is made.
¬¬ Bite carries deadly bacteria; unless cure disease cast,
bite victims suffer infection, fever, and weakness.
After 2d4+1 days, they must make death (poison)
saves to recover, or die.
¬¬ Thrice per day, may vomit nauseous acid on a target
within 10 feet. The victim must make an avoidance
save or suffer an additional 1d6 hp damage
and become a source of revolting odour (with
nauseating effects as above) for one hour.
