These are aquatic, bloodsucking worms up to five feet
in length. They are equipped with sucker mouths at
both ends, attaching to their victims and draining
blood. They are insatiable, drinking the blood of a man
until his death and thenceforth dropping away. They
are encountered in swamp, marsh, pond, lake, and wet
cavern environments; typically they are the bane of
giant herbivores such as aurochs, mammoths, and
sloths.
Special:
¬¬ Chance to surprize increased by 2-in-6 when target
traverses water.
¬¬ Following a hit, drains 1d6 hp per round; must be
killed to be removed.
¬¬ Anticoagulant causes 1 hp damage per round
for 2d4 rounds after leech removed; if tightly
bandaged, blood loss reduced to 1d4 rounds.
