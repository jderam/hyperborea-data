This is a three- to five-foot-long member of the
weasel family that typically hunts small mammals. If
threatened, it can spray odious, eye-watering musk. If
raised from infancy, a giant ferret can be trained, but
adults are known to be temperamental, sometimes
turning on their masters. The pelts of some giant ferrets
can fetch as much as 100 gp.
Special:
¬¬ Musk spray thrice per day has range of 15 feet,
targeting a single victim at a +2 attack bonus; on
successful hit, make death (poison) save or eyes and
throat burn for 1d4 rounds, causing a −2 penalty to
attack rolls and preventing sorcerers from casting
spells.
