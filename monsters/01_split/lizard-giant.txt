Giant lizard species can be encountered in the more
temperate surface areas of Hyperborea during the
spring and summer years, but by Twilight they will
hibernate. Exceptions include specimens that populate
some of the warmer outer islands, such as New
Amazonia, and those that inhabit warm subterranean
lairs.
A giant chameleon is a carnivorous lizard of six-foot
length (plus tail), able to blend with its surroundings.
It attacks by striking with its long, sticky tongue and
then biting. It also can use its 10-foot-long tail to batter
targets. The giant chameleon dwells in all environments
save extreme cold.
A giant draco lizard is a rusty-orange lizard of sevenfoot
length (plus tail). Folds of skin stretch from its
ribs in a fanlike shape, enabling it to glide hundreds of
yards. Giant draco lizards attack in groups, sweeping
down to bite their prey. N.B.: Lizard-men are known to
ride these flying reptiles.
A giant komodo dragon is a fire-breathing lizard
of 20-foot length (plus tail) and 1,200-pound weight,
with a green-brown scaly body, great claws, and sawlike
teeth. It dwells in forests and grasslands, scenting
carrion and driving off other predators; too, this giant
lizard hunts live prey.
A giant tuatara is a carnivorous lizard of eight-foot
length (plus tail), its scales a mottled grey-green. A
nocturnal beast that dwells in its burrow by day, the
giant tuatara rends prey with its claws and powerful
bite, though it oftest feeds on carrion. A subspecies of
skilled swimmers also thrives.
Special (giant chameleon):
¬¬ Blending increases chance to surprize by 2-in-6.
¬¬ If tail sweep hits, target must make avoidance save
or be knocked prone (see Vol. III, p. 242: Combat,
attack modifiers).
Special (giant draco lizard):
¬¬ Initial attack is a swooping bite at a +2 attack
bonus.
Special (giant komodo dragon):
¬¬ Breathes fire thrice per day in a 20-foot-long cone,
10 feet wide at the terminus, for 3d6 hp damage
(avoidance save for ½).
¬¬ Saliva carries deadly bacteria; bite victim must
make death (poison) save or die in 1d4 days.
Special (giant tuatara):
¬¬ Infrared vision (as the spell) to 120-foot range.
¬¬ Saliva carries deadly bacteria; unless cure disease
cast, bite victims suffer infection, fever, and
weakness. After 2d4+1 days, they must make death
(poison) saves to recover, or die.
