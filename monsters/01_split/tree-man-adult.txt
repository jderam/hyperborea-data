Sometimes considered a type of wood elemental,
these strange beings typically dwell in ancient forests.
They are reputed to be the progeny of man and a race
of intelligent trees. Although they present as trees
of vaguely humanoid countenance, they are quite
ambulatory, with long, sinuous arms that open to
claws. Most tree-men are indifferent to the affairs of
men, though some are known to take up proactive
causes for Good or Evil, depending on their individual
proclivities. They can converse both in the various
tongues of man and also their own ancient language.
Tree-men are found in three basic age groups,
determining the tree-man’s size and total HD: An 8-HD
adult tree-man is 9–12 feet tall, a 12-HD old tree-man
is 12–16 feet tall, and a 16-HD ancient tree-man is 16–24
feet tall. Tree-men typically are encountered alone, or
in family groups of mostly adults, with 1 old tree-man
for every 6 and 1 ancient tree-man for every 12. N.B.:
Hyperborean tree-men are all conifers (e.g., fir, pine,
spruce).
