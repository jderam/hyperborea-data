Hunting dogs include several domesticated canine
species that can be trained to a variety of tasks, such
as fetching a bird or pursuing a rabbit from a burrow;
others are utilized strictly for their ability to track prey.
Sled dogs are thick-furred animals, able to withstand
subfreezing environments and trained to pull sleds
across the tundra.
