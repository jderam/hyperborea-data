Giant ants are black-and-red ants of from five- to eightfoot
length, omnivorous and insatiably hungry for
organic material (plant or animal, with a preference for
flesh). Typically they lair in underground nests and will
emerge to attack en masse, but encountering a solitary
soldier returning to the nest
is not unusual.
Special:
¬¬ Upon successful mandible bite, 2-in-6 chance the
creature will arch its metasoma to sting the target at
+2 on the attack roll. If this attack hits, it causes 1 hp
damage and delivers venom; make death (poison) save
or suffer additional 2d8 hp damage.
