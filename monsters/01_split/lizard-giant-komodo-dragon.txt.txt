Giant lizard species can be encountered in the more
temperate surface areas of Hyperborea during the
spring and summer years, but by Twilight they will
hibernate. Exceptions include specimens that populate
some of the warmer outer islands, such as New
Amazonia, and those that inhabit warm subterranean
lairs.
A giant komodo dragon is a fire-breathing lizard
of 20-foot length (plus tail) and 1,200-pound weight,
with a green-brown scaly body, great claws, and sawlike
teeth. It dwells in forests and grasslands, scenting
carrion and driving off other predators; too, this giant
lizard hunts live prey.

10 feet wide at the terminus, for 3d6 hp damage
(avoidance save for ½).
¬¬ Saliva carries deadly bacteria; bite victim must
make death (poison) save or die in 1d4 days.
