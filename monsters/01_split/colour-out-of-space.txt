These vampiric phenomena originate from unearthly
dimensions, typically arriving via meteor. When
the meteorite breaks open, the colour emerges,
presenting as a thousand or more points of unhallowed
phosphorescence, a multi-coloured swarm of dancing
lights exuding palpable, nameless Evil. The colours
dance like corpse-fed fireflies, touching living things
and withering them, drawing their life essence.
That these creatures possess intelligence is undisputed
by sages, but their motives are unfathomable to
even the most learned of men. Typically they hide by
day in dark, wet places and then emerge by night to
feed, flowing like sickening, auroral clouds of 10–40
cubic feet in volume. They prefer to dwell in swamps
or verdant woodlands, where organic material is
abundant. Men, animals, and monsters are reduced
to withered corpses at their touch, and plants wilt to
brown, dry, lifeless things. The very sight of a colour
out of space is reputed to effect madness in the viewer.
N.B.: In Hyperborea, human sacrifices have been made
to colours out of space, believed to bring blessings from
Aurorus, “The Shining One”.
Special:
¬¬ Sight of this monster causes fear; make sorcery
save or flee its presence, babbling, cursing,
and frothing. The save is modified by willpower
adjustment (see Vol. I, p. 9: Attributes, wisdom),
if applicable. This effect lasts for 2d6 turns, though
it is permanent for 0th-level characters.
¬¬ Harmed only by silver or magical weapons.
¬¬ Touch drains 1d2 levels of experience unless a
death save is made (see Vol. III, p. 263: Special
Damage, energy drain).
