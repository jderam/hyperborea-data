This semi-intelligent, conical pillar of roaring flames
is as tall in feet as its HD, with a base of like diameter.
Small gouts of blue or green flames simulate mouth
and eyes, fixed in a furious countenance. When
attacking, fire elementals lash at their victims with
their main bulk. They boil water to steam on contact
and can move across the water’s surface, not unlike a
grease fire.
Special:
¬¬ Fire attacks heal a fire elemental instead of
damaging it, albeit at 50% effectiveness.
¬¬ +1 or better weapon to hit.
¬¬ Inflicts an extra 1d8 hp damage versus cold-based
creatures.
¬¬ Complete water immersion will destroy a fire
elemental in 1 turn, unless it makes a death save, in
which case it will emerge to the surface having lost
half its current hit points.
