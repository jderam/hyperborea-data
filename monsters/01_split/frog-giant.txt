These giant amphibians are up to seven feet in length and
weigh as much as 500 pounds. Each can swallow a man in
a single gulp, using its sticky, 12-foot-long tongue to reel in
prey. Giant frogs inhabit swamps, marshes, lakes, ponds,
rivers, and rainforests, blending with their surroundings
via chameleonic abilities, though they hibernate during
the winter years. They can leap as far as 60 feet in a single
bound, pouncing upon and oft surprizing prey.
Special:
¬¬ Chance to surprize increased by 2-in-6 when leaping
out from water or muck.
¬¬ On a natural 20 attack roll, the tongue reels in and
swallows the victim whole, inflicting 1d6 hp damage
per round thereafter; after 3 rounds, the victim may
asphyxiate (see Vol. III, p. 263: Special Damage,
asphyxia). Swallowed prey can cut its way out with
a WC 1–3 blade, with an attack penalty equal to the
weapon class. If 6 hp damage is inflicted from within,
a large enough rent is cut for escape.
