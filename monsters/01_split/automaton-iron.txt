Automata are humanoid constructs of mad sorcerers
and their ilk, the formulæ for the creation of
which trace back to a bygone age when Atlanteans,
Hyperboreans, and Lemurians commingled sorcery
and science. Strange wires, conduits, batteries, cells,
and circuits are installed in many of these creations,
though no two manuals of automaton creation (see
Vol. V, p. 482: Magical Treasure, miscellaneous
magic items) describe precisely identical processes;
alternative methods of creation were engendered by the
ancients, but this is a lost science in rapidly decaying
Hyperborea.
An iron
automaton is
a 12-foot iron
statue. Most
are moulded
bearing a
weapon, such
as an enormous
sword or
axe. The iron
automaton
is under the
command of its
creator.
Special:
¬¬ +1 or better weapon to hit.
¬¬ Immune to sorcery, except lightning, which
functions as slow spell for 3 rounds.
¬¬ Fire attacks heal the monster instead of damaging
it.
¬¬ Every 7 rounds, can breathe poison gas cloud of
10-cubic-foot volume, as the cloudkill spell.
