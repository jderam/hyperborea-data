These large, armadillo-like creatures consume rust,
which they cause by way of rapid, magically induced
oxidization. The creatures average from three to four
feet in length and weigh as much as 165 pounds. They
each have a pair of long antennæ that radiate up to
three feet from their heads; these “feelers” seek out iron
or steel, which they infect with rust on contact. Rust
monsters then attempt to consume that which they
rust. If attacked, they defend themselves by ramming
their heavy plated bodies against their opponents
(i.e., an overbear attack; see Vol. III, p. 248: Combat
Actions, melee), but they much prefer to steal away
with their provender when possible.
Special:
¬¬ When contact with metal is made, rust effect is
immediate. Metal armour and weapons are at once
oxidized to complete disrepair. Magical armour and
weapons have a 1-in-6 chance per “plus” to not be
affected; e.g., a +2 short sword has a 2-in-6 chance
to resist the effect. Such magic items are not rusted
immediately if the check fails; rather they lose one
“plus” per successful hit that is not resisted.
