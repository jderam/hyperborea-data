Weasels are fairly common in Hyperborea. During the
winter years, their pelts turn from black or brown to
snow white. When they do, such pelts are said to fetch
as much as 20 gp in certain towns and cities.
Giant weasels are nocturnal animals eight feet long,
sleek, swift, and powerful. Their fur colour depends on
species and environment, typically black, white, brown,
or golden. Giant weasels are vicious creatures that,
although omnivorous, are fond of human flesh. They
latch on to prey and siphon blood from their victims.
N.B.: Intelligent giant weasels have been reported, these
being rare and reclusive creatures of Evil alignment.
