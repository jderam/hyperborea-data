Several snake species inhabit Hyperborea. The asp,
python, rattlesnake, spitting cobra, and viper are
some of the more eminent varieties. They hibernate
during the winter years, except perhaps on the warmer
outer islands, such as New Amazonia.
The rattlesnake ranges from four to eight feet in
length, with reticulated black, brown, green, red, tan,
and/or white scales, oft diamond-patterned. It dwells
in deserts or dungeon depths. A rattlesnake’s tail has
a scaly white rattle that it violently shakes to ward off
enemies, though it might not shake its rattle before
attacking. Because of its swiftness, the rattlesnake
strikes twice per round.
Special:
¬¬ Infrared vision (as the spell) to 30-foot range.
¬¬ Bite injects venom twice per day. Victim must make
death (poison) save or suffer additional 2d6 hp
damage, dying in 1d6 turns. Site of wound is purple
and swollen; may become septic if victim survives
(cure disease heals).
