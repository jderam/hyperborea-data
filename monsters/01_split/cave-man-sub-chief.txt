These are quasi-men of robust physicality, with
squat, muscular bodies, thick bones, and apelike
countenances of receding foreheads and pronounced
brow ridges. Cave-men are well adapted to cold
climes, but thrive in all environments. They possess
rudimentary language skills (proto-Keltic), less refined
than those of men, and their technology (tools and
weapons) is notably inferior or even primitive by
comparison.
Hunting parties may be encountered, but typically
cave-men live in tribal groups, dwelling in caves,
stone huts, or tents manufactured from animal skins;
the last might be nomadic groups that follow animal
herds. For every 10 cave-men, there will be 1 sub-chief,
and for every 30 cave-men there will be 1 chieftain. A
large tribe (such as those found on the isles of Narath
and Tarath) likely will have one dominant chieftain,
so other “chieftains” will have some lesser tribal rank,
or they might be considered sub-chiefs with chieftain
statistics.
Cave-men are more sophisticated than other men
might regard them, with complex behavioural rules,
religion, art, and social conventions. Cave and nomadic
tribes alike employ stone-tipped spears, stone or crude
iron axes, slings, and short bows with flint-headed
arrows. In recent times, cave-men less uncommonly
wander into human settlements to engage in trade, but
generally they are not allowed in taverns, inns, and the
like.
Special:
¬¬ Sub-chiefs are +1 to attack rolls and +2 to damage
via weapon mastery and high strength.
