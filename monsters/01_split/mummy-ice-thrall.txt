Ice mummies are corpses that were preserved in
gruesome, withered forms by cold temperatures
and which became inhabited by Evil spirits of the
Hyperborean ice. Their eyes shew a spark of intellect,
but their only goal is the icy death of all living beings.
Their victims are buried in snow and rise as ice
mummy thralls a day later. Whereas the mindless
thralls simply rend their foes as directed by their
frigid masters, ice mummies oft accoutre themselves
with weapons and bits of armour from their halfremembered
mortal lives; too, some are said to ride
gaunt, skeletal warhorses (large undead animals).
Special:
¬¬ Immune to poison, paralysis, fear, and cold.
¬¬ Can detect body heat (as the spell) at will.
¬¬ If exposed to ambient temperatures above 32°F,
must make a death saving throw every round or fall
to pieces. Automatically destroyed if exposed to an
ambient temperature of 60°F or higher.
¬¬ Suffers double damage from normal or magical
fire.
¬¬ Mundane chopping or slashing weapons (e.g., axes,
scimitars, swords) cause ½ damage to ice mummy
thralls; mundane blunt or piercing weapons (e.g.,
hammers, maces, arrows, spears) cause ¼ damage.
Magical weapons of all kinds cause full damage.
