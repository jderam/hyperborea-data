Giant elk are an enormous species of deer with the
largest spread of antlers in all of Hyperborea. They stand
10 feet at the shoulder, weigh as much as 3,000 pounds,
and present an antler spread of as much as 15 feet. In
forests, plains, tundra, and wetlands, solitary stags or a
sibling pair may be encountered, as well as small herds.
Generally giant elk avoid conflict—they merely will
bristle their fur, snort, and face down potential threats—
but some bucks can be uncharacteristically violent during
mating season. N.B.: Though most giant elk are brown of
fur, the rare white stag is a prized hunting trophy; in some
cultures it is venerated as a holy creature,
oft associated with Yoon’Deh.
Special:
¬¬ Charging gore attack results in double damage dice.
¬¬ Can attack two adjacent opponents with a single
charge attack, doubling damage dice for each victim
(see Vol. III, p, 249: Combat Actions, melee).
