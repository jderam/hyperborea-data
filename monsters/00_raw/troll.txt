These repulsively emaciated humanoids stand 8–10
feet tall, with huge noses and beady black eyes. Their
hairless, rubbery, wart-riddled skin is of jaundiced or
glaucous complexion. They are perhaps the ugliest of
humanoids, and their ways are equally cruel.
Trolls speak the Common tongue of man. Typically they
dwell in caves and dungeons, though they might lurk
in old forests and other places of desolation. They enjoy
preying on men, taking sadistic delight in capturing
and tormenting their quarry before devouring it.
Special:
¬¬ Acute sense of smell; can scent prey within one
mile, unless upwind.
¬¬ Regeneration begins 3 rounds after sustaining
damage, healing wounds at a rate of 3 hp per round,
save fire or acid damage. Even if killed they will
regenerate to life (unless all damage is via fire or
acid), limbs reattaching or re-growing as necessary.
