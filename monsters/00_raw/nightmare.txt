This is the steed of the underworld, a dæmon horse
possessed of great power, ridden by dæmons, liches,
spectres, vampires, and other horrors. Nightmares
resemble liches: gaunt, fleshless horses, the eye sockets
containing coals of hellfire. Too, their hooves burn
with black-violet flames as they gallop over land or air,
and when they snort, flames gush from their nostrils.
Clinging to the bones of these fleshless abominations
are rotting coats of black fur, tattered manes, and
tails of black. The teeth of these dæmonic equines are
dagger-like fangs.
Special:
¬¬ Can exhale billowing smoke from
nostrils that clouds vision in a 15-foot
radius, causing opponents to attack at a
−2 penalty.
