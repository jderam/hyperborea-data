This dæmon presents as a 20-foot-long, 5-foot-diameter
segmented worm, with a three-foot-long tail stinger
and a round maw lined with three rows of fangs.
Gnoph-yikk are leprous beasts, pallid white in colour
and lined with pale blue ridges. They typically burrow
in glaciers, creating vast networks of tubes in the ice.
Gnoph-yikk are said to be the spawn of Yikkorth, “The
Ashen Worm”, who is held to have impregnated the
great glaciers of Hyperborea with ice dæmon eggs. Men
of learning hypothesize that as more gnoph-yikk hatch
and mature, they will galvanize Hyperborea’s glaciers
to thicken and once more mantle the whole of the realm
in ice. Certain cryomancer societies prognosticate this
time as “The Great Cleansing of Barbarism and Chaos”.
Special:
¬¬ 7-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For
every CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty
increases by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p. 261: Saving
Throw, spell resistance).
¬¬ Immune to cold.
¬¬ Electricity, fire, and gas attacks inflict ½ damage,
or ¼ damage if save is made.
¬¬ Typically attacks with bite only, unless flanked,
in which case it can bring its sting to bear.
¬¬ Can cast the following spells at will (though
only one at a time): cone of cold, darkness, detect
invisibility, infrared vision, wall of ice.
¬¬ Once per day, can attempt to beckon another
gnoph-yikk to fight alongside it (as reverse of
dismissal), with 2-in-6 chance of success.
