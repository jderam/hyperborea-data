This four-foot-long horned lizard is of deep red colour
and sulphurous reek, with caustic spittle that can be
directed with great accuracy from the narrow tube that
serves as its mouth. In battle it continually fades in
and out of reality in the manner of a blink dog, and an
especial hatred seems to exist betwixt those creatures
and the class iii lesser dæmons. These fiends are known
to lair in lava tubes and barely dormant volcanoes,
whence they sally to gather the human hearts they prize
above all other provender.
Special:
¬¬ 1-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For
every CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty
increases by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p. 261: Saving
Throw, spell resistance).
¬¬ Cold, electricity, fire, and gas attacks inflict
½ damage, or ¼ damage if save is made.
¬¬ In combat they blink in front of their enemies, claw,
and then blink away to a distance of (1d4+1)×10 feet.
Attacking a class iii lesser dæmon requires precise
timing; one first must make a successful test of
dexterity (see Vol. I, p. 7: Attributes, dexterity) to
time a blow possibly to hit this dæmon.
¬¬ Thrice per day, can spew to a range of 50 a glob
of acid that causes damage equal to the dæmon’s
current hit points
(avoidance save for
½ damage).
