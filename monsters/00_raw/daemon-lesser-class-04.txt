Resembling nothing so much as a four-foot-long,
skeletal dog that walks on its hind legs, this dæmon is
of gruesome jaundiced colour and sardonic demeanour.
At will it can fade from view, save for its smirk and
gleaming beady eyes. Unlike most lesser dæmons, it can
speak Common, albeit in a mocking whisper squirming
with maggots. Because they can converse with ages-lost
spirits of the dead, these dæmons oft are summoned for
such a purpose by necromancers and other desperate
fools. However, they scarcely can be trusted to relay
accurate information except under severe duress—or
when the truth is worse than a lie.
Special:
¬¬ 2-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For
every CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty
increases by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p. 261: Saving
Throw, spell resistance).
¬¬ Cold, electricity, fire, and gas attacks inflict
½ damage, or ¼ damage if save
is made.
¬¬ At will (though only
one at a time), can cast
invisibility (self only)
and a form
of speak with
dead that
functions
much
like the
divination
spell, too.
