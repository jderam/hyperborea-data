This 40-foot-long, serpentine dragon has 12 legs and a
large, crocodilian head. It can fold its legs against its
flanks to slither like a massive snake or to swim. The
monster has thick scales of blue or blue-green, with a
pale blue underbelly.
When hunting, the behir will bite and then enfold its
prey, constricting as a python and thrashing. When
facing fighting men or other creatures capable of
defending themselves, the behir will rear up and attack
with six claws and its bite. It also can discharge a
powerful lightning bolt from its open maw. Behirs most
always are encountered alone, unless a mating pair is
chanced upon.
Special:
¬¬ Immune to electricity and poison.
¬¬ Once per day can discharge a 30-foot-long lightning
bolt that inflicts 6d6 hp damage, with avoidance
saves allowed for ½ damage.
¬¬ If bite and at least two claw attacks hit a single
target, victim is wrapped and squeezed for
additional 2d4 hp damage per round. If the behir
is damaged to 50% of its total hit points, it will
release the victim either to fight or retreat (subject
to a morale check). Otherwise, an extraordinary feat
of strength or dexterity (see Vol. I, p. 7: Attributes,
strength and dexterity) might allow one to escape.
