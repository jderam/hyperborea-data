These large, amorphous blobs are
dark grey to black in colour. Some
sages believe they are a primitive
subspecies of shoggoth, or “failed”
shoggoths discarded by their
erstwhile masters, the elder things.
Black puddings typically measure
6–30 feet in diameter, shambling
through subterranean caves and
caverns constantly in search of
nourishment; often one will ooze
through some crack in the floor of a
dungeon and seek its provender.
Black puddings can move across
floors, walls, and ceilings, and they
can pass through small apertures.
They can eat through wood or metal
and generally are corrosive to all
forms of organic material, but they do not affect stone. Wisdom has it
that only fire can destroy them; other attacks simply split them in twain.
Special:
¬¬ Immune to cold.
¬¬ When black pudding is struck by weapons or lightning, a smaller
one is created (e.g., a 3-HD black pudding that causes 1d8 hp
damage), whilst the main body quickly regenerates, its capacities
not reduced.
¬¬ Harmed only by fire; other spells may adversely affect it, but those
that are not fire-related and that normally inflict physical harm
merely will split the creature in twain as noted above.
¬¬ Corrodes leather on contact and metal in 2d4 rounds (including
weapons and armour, though magical metal survives 1 extra round
per “plus”).
