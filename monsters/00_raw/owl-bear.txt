This enormous, ursine beast has the head of a giant
owl, the body of an upright bear, and large, homarine
claws. Owl bears typically stand 8–10 feet tall and weigh
as much as 1,700 pounds. The progeny of sorcerous
experimentation, these unnatural, egg-bearing
creatures are extremely aggressive and may be found
in hills, woodlands, or cave lairs. Typically they are
encountered singly (rogue males) or in small family
groups. Often they will emit terrible shrieks whilst
attacking.
Special:
¬¬ If owl bear hits same victim with both claw attacks,
it hugs for 2d4 hp damage.
