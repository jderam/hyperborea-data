In the depths of the ocean dwell giant octopuses, which
men of Hyperborea oft refer to as the “Spawn of Kraken,
the Dimensional Dweller”. These great leviathans of the
deep weigh as much as 1,000 pounds and have eight
suckered arms of 50-foot length. They lair in undersea
caves and feed nocturnally. Octopuses are of abstruse
intelligence and sinister disposition, notorious for
dragging men from ships or even wharfs to devour
them.
Special:
¬¬ Against underwater foes they may make their full
allotment of attacks; against enemies on ships or
aground they will use two arms to brace themselves
on something solid whilst reaching up with from
one to six remaining arms to snag prey.
¬¬ Each arm delivers 1d6 hp constriction damage per
round after a hit is scored. If two or more arms
strike a single target, the victim is in 2 rounds
pulled to the beaked mouth of the beast, which will
bite automatically for 2d4 hp damage per round
(in addition to constriction damage). To escape
the grasp of a giant octopus, an extraordinary feat
of strength or dexterity can be used to break or slip
free (see Vol. I, p. 7: Attributes, strength and
dexterity). Allies can wrest a victim free if their
strength totals at least 60.
¬¬ One arm is severed or otherwise rendered useless
for every 8 hp damage the monster sustains.
¬¬ If four arms are destroyed or morale otherwise
fails, the monster will release a massive cloud of
ink whilst jetting away at treble movement.
