This is a cubic monster composed of transparent jelly,
typically measuring 10 feet per side. Gelatinous cubes
dwell in subterranean depths, absorbing organic
material; they are attracted to both carrion and living
creatures. The corrosive properties of the jelly do not
affect stone or metal, so coins, rocks, and even weapons
exhibit, seemingly suspended within the transparent
cube. At length the cube will discharge such items, as
well as the bones of any creatures it absorbs.
Special:
¬¬ Immune to cold and electricity.
¬¬ Hit causes paralysis for 2d4 turns unless death save
is made.
