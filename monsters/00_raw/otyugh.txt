The body of an otyugh is somewhat round and of sixfoot
diameter, from which three pillar-like legs emerge,
the feet of which are round and padded like those of
an elephant. Radiating from the top of the body are
three appendages: two tentacles of from six- to eightfoot
length and one central sensory organ of five-foot
length. The former are lined with sharp talons for
rending flesh, the latter with a dozen eyes and hundreds
of tubular bristles that sense offal, carrion, and waste
from hundreds of yards away. At the front of the beast
gapes a sucker-like maw lined with three rows of fangs.
These appalling monsters dwell in lairs subterranean.
Otyughs are notorious dungeon dwellers, feeding on
the dung of other monsters, though they take particular
delight in devouring the raw flesh of men. They almost
always lurk alone and are believed to be asexual.
Special:
¬¬ Bite transmits terminal disease unless death
(poison) save is made. The infection is similar to
typhus, marked by the eruption of a purple rash
within 1d4 days, followed by headaches, fever,
and delirium. Strength and constitution each are
reduced by 1d6 points whilst disease persists. The
victim dies when CN reaches 0, or after 2d6 weeks
in any event.
