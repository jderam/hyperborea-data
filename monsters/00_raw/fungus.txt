Shrieker fungi are unintelligent, ambulatory plants
from three to five feet in height. The fungus’ shape
corresponds to a mushroom, though with a stem of
one-foot diameter and an umbrella-like cap of from
three- to five-foot diameter. Exclusively they thrive in
cool, lightless, subterranean environments.
Shrieker fungi are nontoxic and edible. The
distinguishing feature of this species (besides its
ambulation) is its ability to release an ear-piercing
shriek in reaction to the proximity of light (e.g., torch,
lantern, sorcery) within 30 feet. The shriek lasts for
about three minutes and will begin anew if light still
remains in its presence.
Violet fungi are similar in size and appearance to
shrieker fungi; in fact, the two species might be found
together in subterranean environments. This fungus
is a carrion eater, extending its three thorny branches
(of from three- to five-foot length, emerging from the
cap) to flail approaching victims. The touch of a violet
fungus rots flesh, upon which it then feeds.
Special (shrieker fungus):
¬¬ The shriek of this plant trebles the probability of
attracting wandering monsters.
Special (violet fungus):
¬¬ Touch rots flesh on contact unless death (poison)
save is made. If the save fails, the victim’s flesh rots
rapidly; unless cure disease is cast within 1 turn, a
painful death is imminent.
