This otherworldly parasite is transmitted to a host
(typically a mammal) through contact with infected
fæcal matter. The digestive system of the host is
attacked, proving fatal within 24–48 hours. Dogs,
wolves, and (especially) blink dogs can sense an
infected victim and will howl and bristle in response.
Tentacular horrors fear and loathe blink dogs, which
are immune to affliction.
Upon death, the host sprouts six legs of eight-foot
length, similar to those of a daddy longlegs; typically
these legs burst from the ribcage of the host. From the
back or shoulders of the victim emerge two powerful
tentacles of 12-foot length, edged with sharp horns. The
tentacles are coated with a paralytic enzyme. Paralyzed
victims are consumed by the tentacular horror host’s
mouth, be it that of a man, a dog, a horse, a lion, a bear,
or the like.
Special:
¬¬ Tentacles paralyze on contact for 2d6 turns unless
death save is made.
¬¬ Cure disease can alleviate affliction during
incubation period. Also it can kill a tentacular
horror outright, unless a death save is made.
