The vhuurmis are a degenerate race of quasi-men that
stand some six feet in height and are covered in shaggy,
umber-coloured fur. Their faces are fur-hedged as those
of baboons, except they are disturbingly human, with
bright blue eyes, smooth ruddy skin, and pointed ears.
They wield primitive weapons, and they communicate
via a complex barking and howling language. Typically
they lair in caves that pock the faces of sheer mountain
walls and are generally inaccessible to most other
creatures.
The vhuurmis are amongst the more ancient races
native to Hyperborea. When the decadent empire of the
snake-men fell, it was the vhuurmis who, from their
cliff-side palaces, ruled the Hyperborean mainland
for ages; they rose to power and then degenerated
to savagery. The first men followed: Hyperborean
witches and warlocks who wrested control and hunted
the vhuurmis. The dwindling vhuurmis retreated to
Mount Vhuurmithadon, a treble-peaked volcano deep
in the Spiral Mountain Array. Then came the Green
Death. Mankind was driven to nigh extinction, and in
the subsequent Dark Age, the vhuurmis rebounded.
Presently their savage tribes populate mountain lairs
all about the realm.
