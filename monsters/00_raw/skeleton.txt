Animated and conjured to service by the baleful sorcery
of magicians, clerics, and the like, these are the bones
of men or humanoids, undead creatures typically found
in crypts, dungeons, and other forsaken locales. Often
they are charged with guardianship of a person, place,
or thing, and they can wield weapons and shields. As
undead they can be harmed by holy oil / water. They also
can be turned by clerics and the like, but otherwise they
fight until destroyed. Large skeletons are the animate
bones of albino apes, carnivorous apes, mountain
apes, or minotaurs; giant skeletons are the animate
forms of fire giants, frost giants, or hill giants.
Special:
¬¬ Shield-bearing skeletons are common; they gain
+1 AC.
¬¬ Immune to poison, paralysis, fear, and cold.
¬¬ Edged and piercing weapons cause ½ damage
against them (damage dice halved, with bonuses
added afterwards), but blunt weapons inflict
normal damage.
