Several small, inoffensive shark species (such as the
dogfish) are found in Hyperborea, but the largest and
deadliest is the great white. These carnivorous killers
are identified by their prominent dorsal fins. The great
white shark has established itself as one of the top
predators of the sea, thriving in the cool waters. Great
whites have been reported to achieve lengths of up to
30 feet and will attack vessels of any size, tearing to
shreds the thickest hulls.
Special:
¬¬ Successful hit followed by 2d8 hp damage per
round from ripping and shaking
prey.
