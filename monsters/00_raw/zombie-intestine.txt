Originally created by the Ixian necromancer Yileenda,
intestine zombies present as common zombies. Within
30 feet, however, illuminance (and a careful eye) may
reveal a large stitched seam running from neck to waist—
and serpentine writhing beneath the abdominal skin.
At about 20 feet distance from its victim, the intestine
zombie’s abdominal seam bursts open, releasing foul,
bile-oozing intestines that unravel through the air to
entangle foes with unnatural strength. Once entangled,
the victim is strangled slowly until he passes out.
An unbound intestine zombie then will devour its
incapacitated foe, but if under the command of a master,
it may carry off its victim for unspeakable atrocities.
Special:
¬¬ Immune to poison, paralysis, fear, and cold.
¬¬ Arrows and bolts inflict but 1 hp damage (plus
bonuses, if applicable); other piercing / thrusting
weapons cause ½ damage (damage dice halved,
with bonuses added afterwards).
¬¬ Intestine zombies always attempt to engage
enemies from a distance with their intestines’ 20-
foot reach, oftest gaining first strike (see Vol. III, p.
244: Combat, initiative).
¬¬ Following the initial damage of a successful attack,
the bile-covered intestine curls around the throat
of the victim. After 3 rounds, the victim may
asphyxiate (see Vol. III, p. 263: Special Damage,
asphyxia).
¬¬ Intestines struck for 10 hp damage are severed or
rendered useless; this damage does not detract
from the monster’s overall hit point total.
Alternatively, intestines can be broken with
an extraordinary feat of strength (see Vol. I, p. 7:
Attributes, strength).
