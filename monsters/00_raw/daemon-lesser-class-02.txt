This lowly dæmon resembles a three-foot-long,
deformed lizard of glossy burnt umber colouration.
Its powerful legs allow it to make prodigious leaps,
often in unexpected directions. With intent to devour
it attacks any unprotected living creature. If unleashed
on Hyperborea, a swarm of these dæmons will pick a
region entirely clean of flesh.
Special:
¬¬ 1-in-20 spell resistance versus CA 12 casters. For
every CA level less than 12, the chance-in-twenty
increases by one (+1) (see Vol. III, p. 261: Saving
Throw, spell resistance).
¬¬ Cold, electricity, fire, and gas attacks inflict
½ damage, or ¼ damage if save is made.
¬¬ At will, can make powerful leaps as per the jump
spell.
