This is the two-legged dragon of myth and legend, with
large pteropine wings, ruddy grey scales, red eyes, and a
long, barbed tail. Wyverns possess limited intelligence,
their communication slightly more advanced than
normal reptiles. This beast attacks with a venomous tail
sting, poisoning its victims before devouring them.
Wyverns thrive in many environments, including the
deepest dungeons and subterranean caverns.
Special:

make death (poison) save
or suffer instant paralysis,
followed by death in 2d4
rounds.
