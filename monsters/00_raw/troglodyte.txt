Troglodytes are reptilian humanoids of primitive
intelligence, capable of weapon use and simple technology.
They are violent creatures who despise men and attack on
sight. They dwell in subterranean caverns or dungeons,
and they see in the dark through bulging, lamp-like eyes.
Troglodytes have scaly skin, long legs, short tails, and
spiny combs that protrude from head, neck, and back;
smaller combs protrude from the backs of their arms.
The digits of their hands and feet are webbed, and they
are superior swimmers, able to hold their breath for as
long as two hours. These creatures also possess natural
chameleonic abilities and can emit a musk scent that
nauseates other creatures. For every 20 troglodytes, there
will be 1 troglodyte chieftain, an exceptional beast with
overlapping, chitinous scales.
Special:
¬¬ Chameleonic ability increases chance to surprize
enemies by 2-in-6.
¬¬ Nauseating musk odour surrounds them in 10-foot
radius; make death (poison) save or suffer −2 attack
penalty for
1d6 rounds.
