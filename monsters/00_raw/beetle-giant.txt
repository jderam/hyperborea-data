The bombardier beetle is a five-foot-long insect that
inhabits swamps and woodlands, feeding on carrion
and dung. It uses the latter to build its nest: a dung
tower of 30-foot height with a 30-foot-diameter base. It
does not attack unless surprized or threatened; if so, it
will turn to release its terrible vapour bomb (see Special).
The fire beetle is a giant insect of from 3- to 3½-foot
length, with large, serrated pincers. Fire beetles are
found in two distinct types: one, subterranean; the
other, aboveground, nocturnal bog dwellers.
(The latter oft are referred to as “jigs” because of the
male’s strange mating rituals: It will stand erect on
its hind legs and perform a dance to attract females.)
Two brightly glowing glands are located above the
fire beetle’s eyes, with a third by the abdomen. For the
subterranean type, these glands radiate red light in a
10-foot radius; surface-dwellers present a more fulvous
phosphorescence. If a fire beetle’s glands are extracted
carefully, they will continue to glow for 1d6 days.
The stag beetle is the most enormous of giant beetles,
with a body of 12-foot length and horns that project
another 8–10 feet. Heavily armoured and given little
cause to fear most predators, these enormous insects
are the bane of crop farmers, oft consuming an entire
harvest in the course of one night (though they attack
men only if incited). They typically travel alone or in
pairs.
Special (bombardier beetle):
¬¬ Once per day, can release from its posterior a
noxious vapour bomb 10 cubic feet in volume. The
cloud is acidic and inflicts 2d6 hp damage to any
creature in the area of effect. Furthermore, the
release is coupled with a sonic boom that will
stun any creature within 20 feet unless it makes
a transformation save. If the saving throw
fails, the victim is stunned for 1d6 rounds
(see Vol. III, p. 242: Combat, attack
modifiers) and deafened for an additional
1d6 turns. A deaf creature is surprized
on a base 4-in-6 chance and suffers an
individual initiative penalty of −2
(i.e., the deaf creature may lose initiative,
despite its allies winning; see Vol. III,
p. 244: Combat, surprize and initiative).
Other penalties may apply, at the referee’s
discretion.
