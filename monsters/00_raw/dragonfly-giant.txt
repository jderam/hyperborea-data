A giant dragonfly is a swift-flying, carnivorous insect
of two-foot length and three-foot wingspan. These
brightly coloured insects dwell about the foetid waters
of swamps and marshlands. They most commonly
are found in the wetlands of the outer islands of
Hyperborea, such as New Amazonia and the Floating
Island of Paradoxon, though it is not unusual to
encounter giant dragonflies in the forest depths of New
Pictland and the Savage Boreal Coast. Giant dragonflies
mostly subsist on small animals, such as mice, voles,
frogs, and fish. Although they do not actively seek to
attack men, they are vigorous defenders of their territory.
