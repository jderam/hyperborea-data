These massive, manlike brutes of repulsive countenance
and abhorrent odour stand 8–10 feet tall and weigh as
much as 1,000 pounds. Their torsos are thick with black
or red fur, but their arms and bowed legs are as those
of cave-men; their misshapen heads are hairy of mane
and beard, and their noses large and broad. Mountain
apes typically wield clubs, stone axes, or stone-tipped
spears, though some acquire the weapons of man.
Others will hurl stones, or simply pound with their
fists.
Mountain apes are greedy and oft store their wealth
in cave lairs, though some fear leaving their treasure
for others to plunder and so will carry it in large sacks.
Most are thoroughly Evil, though a simpleminded,
good-natured sort is not impossible. Often they dwell
alone and are wont to kidnap human children (whom
they will enslave and/or eat).
Special:
¬¬ Can hurl a large stone to a range of 50 for 1d10+2 hp
damage.
