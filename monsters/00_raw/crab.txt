Giant crabs are crustaceans with shells spanning as
much as five feet in diameter. Typically they are red,
green, or blue. Although aquatic, they thrive on land as
well as in water (fresh or salt), digging shallow burrows.
Giant crabs are voracious eaters and have a taste for
warm-blooded creatures, rending them with their
powerful claws. Although they lack intelligence, giant
crabs sometimes are trained by crab-men to serve as
guardians and trackers. Usually they are encountered at
a sandy beach, swamp, or river delta.
Monstrous crabs have been reported, with shells
that span 15–20 feet in diameter. Such horrors are
believed to be hundreds of years old, and always they
are encountered singly. They have been come upon in
vast subterranean lakes, the ocean deeps, and beneath
glacial ice.
Special (giant crab):
¬¬ When emerging to attack from a burrowed
position, giant crabs enjoy a 1-in-6 bonus to
surprize; monstrous crabs are too slow to gain the
same advantage.
