This is a large, furry, wild ox that roams arctic plains.
Its long, shaggy coat and soft undercoat provide
warmth in the coldest regions, and its great hooves are
used to scrape and clear away ice so as to access the
grass underneath. Bulls stand five feet at the shoulder
and weigh as much as 800 pounds; cows are smaller.
Bulls have prominent horns that they use to fight
one another or make ostentatious mating displays.
Rarely are musk oxen encountered in small numbers;
typically they roam in large herds. When predators
are inescapable, the oxen will form defensive circles,
protecting their young and ready to gore with their
horns if approached.
