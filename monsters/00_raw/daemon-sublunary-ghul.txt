In their natural state, these shape-shifting dæmons
present as emaciated humanoids of from seven- to
nine-foot height, with cadaverously pale skin, stringy
hair, and black, sunken eyes. Their long arms end
in blood-red talons, and their double-rowed teeth
triangulate like those of a shark. Ghuls dwell in deserts
and tundra; highly intelligent and manipulative, they
oft assume positions of leadership over lesser species
such as hyæna-men, orcs, and vhuurmis. Ghuls are
loathed by most men, notorious for robbing graves
from which they either take their provender or, in some
cases, utilize a cadaver for baleful necromancies and
other foul rites. Ghuls are noted
servants of Mordezzan, and when
in the dead of night they arrive
in charnel houses, the black
priests of Mordezzan
will lavish upon the
dæmons all their
unspeakable
desires.
