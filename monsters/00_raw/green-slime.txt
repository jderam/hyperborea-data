This formless terror appears as a green, dripping, algal
growth. In colonies it exists in subterranean dungeons
and wet caverns, where it seeks warm-blooded creatures
to use as hosts from which to feed and multiply. Often
a green slime colony dwells in ceiling cracks, waiting to
fall upon unsuspecting prey.
The creature dissolves all material except stone. It burns
through clothing in 2 rounds, through leather in 4
rounds, and through metal in 6 rounds; likewise, weapons
that contact green slime are destroyed in 6 rounds. Once
contact with flesh is established, at once the green slime
begins to transform its host. N.B.: These creatures are
listed with movement 0 but in fact they can move about
12 inches per day, positioning themselves advantageously.
Special:
¬¬ Unharmed by all weapons and spells, except fire and
cold. If a fire or cold spell is used against a slime that
is affixed to a victim, the creature and victim both
suffer full normal damage. (Each is allowed a saving
throw, if applicable.)
¬¬ Cure disease destroys a green slime.
¬¬ Once flesh is contacted, victim becomes green slime
in 1d4 rounds; no saving throw is allowed.
¬¬ Effects avoided if scraped off within 1 round of
contact and scraping tool is then cast aside.
