AUTOMATON (Golem, Living Statue)
Automata are humanoid constructs of mad sorcerers
and their ilk, the formulæ for the creation of which
trace back to a bygone age when Atlanteans, Hyperboreans,
Lemurians, and the Mu commingled sorcery
and science. Strange wires, conduits, batteries, cells,
and circuits are installed in many of these creations,
though no two manuals of automaton creation describe
precisely identical processes; alternative methods
of creation were engendered by the ancients, but
this is a lost science in rapidly decaying Hyperborea.
BRONZE AUTOMATON (Minotron): A bronze
automaton is a massive 10-foot construct built to resemble
a minotaur. Often referred to as a minotron, a
typical bronze automaton is fashioned to wield a great
spear, halberd, or long trident, composed entirely of
bronze. The bronze automaton is ever obedient and
under the
command of
its creator,
though
it only
responds
to clear
and loudly
vocalized
commands.
N.B.: The
golden heart
of a felled
bronze
automaton,
if extracted,
has a 12,000-
gp value.
Bronze Automaton: #E 1 | AL N | SZ L | MV 30
DX 9 | AC 2 | HD 10+2 | #A 1/1 (gore or weapon)
D 2d8 or 4d6 | SV 12 | ML 12 | XP 2,200 | TC nil
Special:
 Charging Gore: Can deliver charging gore
attack at +2 “to hit” and double damage.
 Fire Heals: Fire attacks heal the monster
instead of damaging it.
 Immunities: Immune to all sorcery, except
lightning, which functions as slow spell for
3 rounds. Immune to mundane weapons;
harmed only by magical weapons.
CLAY AUTOMATON: A clay automaton is a humanoid
statue eight feet tall. The clay automaton is
under its creator’s command; typically, the creature
is appointed a task, such as guardianship. N.B.: Clay
automata are prone to possession by dæmons.
Clay Automaton: #E 1 | AL N | SZ L | MV 20
DX 5 | AC 7 | HD 11+2 | #A 1/1 (pummel) | D 3d10
SV 12 | ML 12 | XP 2,700 | TC nil | Special:
 Immunities: Immune to all sorcery, except
for disintegrate and transmute rock to mud,
either of which necessitates a death save or
the creature is destroyed. Unharmed by edged
or pointed weapons of all types (magical and
mundane); only blunt weapons (flail, hammer,
mace, etc.) of magical nature are effective.
 Permanent Damage: Damage from attacks
cannot be healed, save by the sorcery of a
cleric or priest of 9th level or greater; otherwise,
damage inflicted is permanent, unless a remove
curse spell is cast.
CRYSTAL AUTOMATON: A crystal automaton is a
human-shaped limpid construct, its smooth, faceless
exterior shewing crackling, bluish-white energy within.
Unlike most automata, this creature exhibits sentience,
oftest housing the consciousness of a learned
individual. Some ancient Atlantean scientists employed
such forms to achieve a measure of immortality; the
secret of their creation has been lost as the Atlantean
race has declined. These creatures cannot speak, but
can communicate telepathically, usually in the Hellenic
(Atlantean) and Hellenic (Hyperborean) dialects.
Crystal Automaton: #E 1 | AL any | SZ M | MV 30
DX 9 | AC 0 | HD 2+2 | #A 2/1 (pummel/pummel)
D 1d6/1d6 | SV 16 | ML 10 | XP 101 | TC nil | Special:
 Immunities: Immune to acid, cold, electricity,
fire, gas, poison, and all sorcery. Immune to mundane
weapons; harmed only by magical weapons.
FLESH AUTOMATON: A flesh automaton is built
from the corpses of at least five humans. Though the
creature is impervious to most harm (unless magical),
the creator might yet gird an automaton in armour.
The flesh automaton obeys the will of its creator; commands
must be simple, for the brute retains limited
intelligence.
Flesh Automaton: #E 1 | AL N | SZ M | MV 30
DX 7 | AC 7 | HD 9+2 | #A 2/1 (pummel) | D 2d8/2d8
SV 12 | ML 11 | XP 1,600 | TC nil | Special:
 Electricity Heals: Electrical attacks heal the
monster instead of damaging it.
 Immunities: Immune to charm, hold, sleep, and
other mind-affecting sorcery. Immune to mundane
weapons; harmed only by magical weapons.
 Loss of Control: Each round of combat, 1-in-10
chance of losing control, attempting to kill all in
sight. It attacks at +2 “to hit” and damage rolls
and then flees after 2d6 rounds. It thereafter
wanders aimlessly, avoiding civilization; rehabilitation
is no simple matter. Some flesh automata
are said to manifest rudimentary intelligence
and emotion after such episodes.
IRON AUTOMATON: An iron automaton is a 12-foot
iron statue. Most are moulded bearing a weapon, such
as an enormous sword or axe. The iron automaton is
under the command of its creator.
Iron Automaton: #E 1 | AL N | SZ L | MV 20
DX 5 | AC 3 | HD 16+2 | #A 1/1 (weapon) | D 4d10
SV 9 | ML 12 | XP 6,000 | TC nil | Special:
 Breathe Poison: Every 7 rounds, can breathe
poison gas cloud of 10-cubic-foot volume, as the
cloudkill spell.
 Fire Heals: Fire attacks heal the monster
instead of damaging it.
 Immunities: Immune to all sorcery, except
lightning, which functions as slow spell for
3 rounds. Immune to mundane weapons;
harmed only by magical weapons.
SCYTHE AUTOMATON: A scythe automaton is a
nine-foot-tall, thin humanoid construct with a metallic
body and blades that extend at the end of each arm.
Relics of ancient sorcery and science, scythe automata
generally are used as simple guardian creatures, programmed
to follow basic, pre-determined orders. They
will not attack unless triggered, but once they do, they
strike with their edged arms, slicing with vicious fury
until each enemy is destroyed. After completing their
orders, they return to their original positions and resume
hibernation until triggered again.
Scythe Automaton: #E 1d2 | AL N | SZ L
MV 30 | DX 5 | AC 3 | HD 7+2 | #A 2/1 (blade/
blade) D 1d10/1d10 | SV 13 | ML 12 | XP 840 | TC nil
Special:
 Immunity: Immune to mundane weapons;
harmed only by magical weapons. Immune to
charm, hold, sleep, and other mind-affecting
sorcery.
 Resistances: Edged or pointed weapons cause
only ½ damage; blunt weapons deal full damage.
STONE AUTOMATON: A stone automaton is a
10-foot-tall statue chiselled from granite or marble, oft
with the likeness of a sword or an axe in hand. Stone
automata are the least intelligent type, able to comprehend
seven simple commands which must be programmed
during creation. Typical commands include
“Attack!”, “Capture!”, “Follow!”, “Stop!”, and “Wait!”
Ambiguous commands such as “Guard!” may be misunderstood;
the monster might guard a place instead
of a person, even if a person was the intent.
Stone Automaton: #E 1 | AL N | SZ L | MV 20
DX 5 | AC 5 | HD 14+2 | #A 1/1 (weapon) | D 6d6
SV 10 | ML 12 | XP 3,250 | TC nil | Special:
 Immunities: Immune to all sorcery, except
stone to flesh (renders creature AC 8 and vulnerable
to normal weapons for 1d4 rounds) and
transmute rock to mud (functions as slow spell
for 2d6 rounds). Immune to mundane weapons;
harmed only by magical weapons.
