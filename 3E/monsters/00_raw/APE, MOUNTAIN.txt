APE, MOUNTAIN (Ogre)
These massive, humanoid brutes of repulsive countenance
and abhorrent odour stand 8–10 feet tall and
weigh as much as 1,000 pounds. Their torsos are thick
with black or red fur, but their arms and bowed legs
are as those of cave-men; their misshapen heads are
hairy of mane and beard, and their noses large and
broad. Mountain apes typically wield clubs, stone
axes, or stone-tipped spears, though some acquire the
weapons of mankind. Others will hurl stones, or simply
pound with their fists.
Mountain apes are greedy and oft store their wealth
in cave lairs, though some fear leaving their treasure
for others to plunder and so will carry it in large sacks.
Most are thoroughly Evil, though a simpleminded,
good-natured sort is not impossible. They often dwell
alone and are wont to kidnap human children (whom
they enslave and/or eat).
