AERIAL MINION
This semi-intelligent species of air elemental is conjured
by clerics or cryomancers of no small power (see
summon aerial minion spell). They are naturally invisible;
even if revealed by sorcery or otherwise, they
appear as dim, nebulous shapes of eight-foot height
somewhat conforming to anthropoid dimensions. When
bound to service they will not fight, for their function is
to find and retrieve; they are strong and quick, able to
bear as much as 1,000 pounds and move unencumbered.
If bidden to retrieve a creature of Small or Medium size,
the aerial minion attempts to seize its quarry with force
(a grapple attempt). Typically, an aerial minion attacks
only when it must defend itself, or if it is bewildered by
its assignment, the latter case causing it to become insane
and return to kill its summoner.

strength can break its grapple hold.

weeks old.

like means to penetrate invisibility receives a +4
“to hit.” Destroyed by dispel magic versus the
summoner’s CA.
