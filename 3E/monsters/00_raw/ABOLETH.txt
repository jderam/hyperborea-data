ABOLETH
Aboleths are massive alien beasts, up to 10 feet tall
and 7–8 feet thick, their scaly, blue-green bodies coated
with mucous slime. They have thick, fluked tails of 12-
foot length and four anterior, sucker-bearing tentacles,
each about 10 feet long, which they use to drag their
bulk when on land. Centred amongst the tentacles is
a circular mouth lined with three rows of triangular
teeth. Three violet eyes, narrow slits in succession, are
set atop a bulky head.
This ancient race of intelligent amphibious monsters
inhabits subterranean lakes and caverns. Aboleths
hate other sentient life, slaying or enslaving humans
and humanoids. Hoarders of otherworldly knowledge,
aboleths are enemies of elder things, the Great Race,
and mi-go, but are known to ally with fish-men, fellow
advocates of Kthulhu. Indeed, aboleths are said
to receive dreaming Kthulhu’s edicts when they take
their yearlong slumber. Typically, few aboleths are encountered,
but Atlantean sages speak of large colonies
dwelling in subaqueous cities of alien architecture.

TC F | Special:
 Illusion: At will, to a range of 240 feet, effect a
vivid illusion of sight, sound, and smell (see advanced
spectral phantasm spell); must maintain
concentration for the illusion to persist.
 Mind Control: Thrice per day, impose mind
control ability on all within 30 feet. Targets must
roll a sorcery saving throw, modified by willpower
adjustment, if applicable. Those who fail will
serve and obey the aboleth. The enslaved will
not bring harm to friends or former associates,
but they will abide other telepathic commands
if aboleth is within one mile. Dispel magic or
remove curse terminates enchantment.
 Mucous Cloud: In water, release a mucous
cloud three feet around its bulk. A victim pulled
into the cloud must make a transformation
save or thenceforth be unable to breathe air. If
removed from water, a test of constitution must
be made every round. The first time the test is
failed, the victim begins to asphyxiate for 1d4
damage per round. Aboleths use this cloud to
grant their slaves the ability to breathe water,
albeit in smaller doses so as to effect amphibious
humanoid slaves.
 Slime: If tentacle hits, victim must make
transformation save or skin mutates into slimy
membrane in 1d4+1 minutes unless cure disease
is cast. Once metamorphosis is complete, victim
must remain immersed or their skin dries out,
causing 2d6 hp damage per turn. Heal can end
this affliction.
