APE-MAN
These quasi-humans walk upright as humans; males
are from five to six feet tall, females from four to five
feet tall on average. Ape-men have the base countenance
and body hair of an ape and a body type that
presents with human and simian characteristics, including
opposable thumbs. Culturally they range from
utter primitivism (fire and stone tool use) to mock
sophistication and reason rivalling the lowliest of mankind.
Ape-men communicate via a limited vocabulary
of grunts, growls, hoots, and trills. Brutish and violent,
ape-men are omnivorous, though preferring raw meat.
Their warriors and hunters wear the hides of beasts;
some don human armour when opportunity presents.
Weapons include clubs, slings, and hand-hurled stones,
unless the ape-men acquire steel.
Ape-man tribes dwell in caves, mountains, and forests.
About 1 in 12 is an ape-man alpha, a physically dominant
humanoid. Also, most tribes of 20 or more individuals
will have a shaman; these sorcerers typically
hallow Yug or Xathoqqua.
N.B.: An advanced group of some 5,000 ape-men populates
the City-State of Kor and serves as its ruling elite.
These ape-men can read and write, forge weapons and
tools of iron and steel, and assume the principle classes
of fighter, magician, cleric, and thief. Some sages posit
these elevated ape-men to be the beneficiaries of otherworldly
sponsorship.
