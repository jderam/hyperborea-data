APE, ALBINO (White Ape)
The albino ape is a massive white simian dwelling in
caves and caverns. Adult males grow up to seven feet
high and weigh as much as 600 pounds; females are
slightly smaller. Nocturnal and carnivorous, these
gorilla-like beasts demonstrate limited intelligence
through primitive tool use.
Typically, they live in groups of 7–10, with one alpha
male, two or three females, and the remainder young;
otherwise, adult males live solitarily, though a sibling
pair is possible. If approached, the apes will pound
their chests and roar. One who carefully backs away
might escape (3-in-6 chance); otherwise, the apes react
violently. Albino apes are known to emerge in the black
of night to chase Ythaqqa, “The Wendigo,” across the
Plain of Leng, howling and frothing in bestial rapture.
The albino ape superior is a rare specimen, always
male. Born with six limbs—two pairs of massive arms
and one pair of stout legs—it grows to nine feet and
weighs as much as 1,100 pounds. These apes are much
as their cousins, though they can manipulate weapons
and are possessed of slightly elevated intelligence (and
no small amount of wickedness); some have learnt to
speak the Common tongue of mankind. They oft assume
leadership of albino apes, brooding ape-kings.

 Strangle: If all four claw attacks strike one
opponent, strangulation ensues the next round,
causing 1d8+2 hp damage per round. An extraordinary
feat of strength can break the ape’s grasp;
serious damage also may compel the beast to let
go. Rare victims who survive this attack have
been known to lose their voices forever.
