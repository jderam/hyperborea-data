APE, CARNIVOROUS
These are massive, 400-pound, seven-foot-tall,
flesh-eating gorillas of brutish and cunning intelligence.
They have large fists with black-taloned fingers.
Carnivorous apes often dwell in hidden places, such as
caves, dungeons, or forests deep. They take great pleasure
in eating the raw flesh of humans and are keen
to their scent; likewise, they hate and prey upon other
ape species, though they rightly fear the four-armed
albino ape superior. Carnivorous apes are notorious
for their keen eyesight, hearing, and olfaction; they
use these enhanced senses and their shrewd cunning
to stalk enemies.
A rare variation of the carnivorous ape is said to dwell
in the remote peaks of the Spiral Mountain Array.
These simians conform to carnivorous ape appearance,
except they have hollow bones and great, membranous
bat wings. Clever and intelligent, these brutes revel in
cruelty. They are said to capture human females and
convey them to their wicked lairs.
