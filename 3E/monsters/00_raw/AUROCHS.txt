AUROCHS
This massive species of ox stands six feet at the shoulder,
weighs as much as 2,000 pounds, and is renowned
for its wide spread of forwards-turning horns. Most
aurochs have black fur, which is shaggier during cold
periods. Temperamental and aggressive, these bovines
will charge down a human or humanoid, including those
who attempt to avoid them. Castrated bulls, if taken as
calves, may be used as draught animals. Solitary bulls
might be encountered, or small herds.
