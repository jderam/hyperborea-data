ARCHÆOPTERYX
This crow-sized, antediluvian bird is of rare and colourful
plumage. It has a lengthy reptilian tail with
long feathers of blue, green, black, and pink, though
other colour combinations have been reported. The
archæopteryx’s beak is lined with small, sharp teeth;
also, three finger-like claws extend from the wing
joints, used to climb trees and rocks. Archæopteryges
dwell in regions of high elevation that are volcanically
active; also, they have been observed on remote islands
and in ancient forests. Typically, they feed on carrion
and small animals (amphibians, birds, mammals, and
reptiles). Legends speak of a two-headed, intelligent
species of archæopteryx that inhabits the volcanic regions
of the Spiral Mountain Array.
