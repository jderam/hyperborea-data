ANT, GIANT
Giant, segmented insect with pronounced antennae,
a tough exoskeleton, and a complex social order. Both
species are considered the byproduct of sorcerous augmentation.
GIANT ANT: Giant ants are black-and-red insects
from five- to eight-feet in length. They are omnivorous
and insatiably hungry for organic material (plant or
animal, with a preference for flesh). Typically, they lair
in underground nests and emerge to attack en masse,
but encountering a solitary soldier returning to the
nest is not unusual.
Giant Ant: #E 1 (3d6) | AL N | SZ M | MV 60 | DX 12
AC 3 | HD 4 | #A 1/1 (bite) | D 1d8 | SV 15 | ML 8
XP 90 | TC Q (×3), S | Special:
 Sting: Upon successful mandible bite, 2-in-6
chance the creature arches its metasoma to sting
the target at +2 “to hit.” If this attack hits, it causes
1d3 hp damage and delivers venom; make death
(poison) save or suffer additional 2d8 hp damage.
GIANT RADIOACTIVE ANT: Giant radioactive ants
are giant ants that have been irradiated by green diamonds.
They present with pale grey, translucent exoskeletons,
under which their internal organs glow iridescent
green, most notably the metasoma (posterior).
Giant radioactive ants are carnivorous and insatiably
hungry. They also display limited intelligence, communicating
over vast distances via a warbling whistle
emitted by their vibrating antennæ. This sound also
can produce a mesmerizing effect (see below). Giant radioactive
ants oft congregate in threes, head-to-head,
antennæ taking to a brighter, pulsating green glow.
The significance of this activity is not yet understood.
Giant Radioactive Ant: #E 2d4 (3d6) | AL N | SZ M
MV 60 | DX 13 | AC 3 | HD 4 | #A 1/1 (bite) | D 1d8
SV 15 | ML 8 | XP 180 | TC Q (×4) | Special:
 Radiation Sting: Upon successful mandible bite,
2-in-6 chance the creature arches its metasoma to
sting the target at +2 “to hit.” If this attack hits,
it causes 1d3 hp damage and delivers a lethal dose
of radiation; make a death (radiation) save or die
in 1d6 turns. Even if death is averted, the victim
suffers complete loss of hair within 24 hours;
recurrent nausea results as well.
 Warble: Warbling whistle can be used to communicate
with other giant radioactive ants within
two miles, or it can be modified to mesmerize a
single mammal within 240 feet. The target must
make a sorcery save, modified by willpower
adjustment, if applicable. If the save fails, the
victim enters a trance, dropping anything held
and blindly walking toward the warbler, presenting
a defenceless target to be devoured.
